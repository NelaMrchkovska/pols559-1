# POLS 559: Text as Data
This class introduces computational approaches for collecting, preparing and analyzing text as data. It is not a programming class but you will need to do some programming to complete assignments. The main goal of the class is to survey computational approaches that have essentially the same objectives as other quantitative studies - counting, scaling and grouping.
