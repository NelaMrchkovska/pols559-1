The battle over the future direction of conservative politics in Germany is in full swing following the decision of Angela Merkel’s would-be successor to withdraw from the leadership of the Christian Democrats.
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer’s surprise resignation as CDU leader and potential chancellor candidate on Monday has plunged the country into a period of profound political uncertainty, and left the party faithful heatedly wrangling over whether to continue their centrist course or embrace a tougher form of conservatism in order to win back voters who have drifted to the hard-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).
Not only has Kramp-Karrenbauer’s move crushed Merkel’s well-laid-out plans for her own orderly retirement and succession, but it has also laid bare the fractured nature of the conservatives, reflecting similar divisions in traditional parties across Europe.
Although the race to find a successor to Kramp-Karrenbauer has not officially begun, candidates were lining up and had already been in touch with each other, according to German media reports on Tuesday that cited as prime contenders Friedrich Merz, the former leader of the CDU parliamentary group who narrowly lost the leadership contest in December 2018, Jens Spahn, the current health minister, and Armin Laschet, the prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Markus Söder, the state premier of Bavaria from the CDU’s sister party, the Christian Social Union, has repeatedly said he will not run, despite growing calls among conservatives for him to do so.
A new leader was expected to be chosen by the end of the year, Kramp-Karrenbauer said on Monday, insisting the CDU would be “fit in terms of content, personnel and organisation” for the next scheduled federal elections in 2021. Leading members of the CDU and its coalition partner, the Social Democratic party (SPD), have expressed their concerns that the timetable is too long. The greater the wait, the greater the instability, they argue, amid fears that the AfD will seek to fill the political vacuum.
Neither elections nor an earlier than expected end to Merkel’s term in office have been ruled out, with a growing consensus even among her staunchest supporters that Merkel’s presence is hindering the CDU’s ability to restructure itself. Merkel, who called Kramp-Karrenbauer’s decision, which reportedly also took her by surprise, “regrettable”, is also seen to have been considerably weakened.
At a meeting of high-ranking CDU members on Monday, the most pressing question was how the conservatives should deal with the AfD, to which it has lost millions of voters, amid growing recognition that it is being repeatedly outmanoeuvred by them.
At the heart of its crisis are the differing opinions as to whether it should exclude the AfD or enter talks with it, after CDU politicians in the eastern state of Thuringia ignored long-held party rules last week and voted with the far-right party to oust the state’s popular and respected premier, Bodo Ramelow of the leftwing Die Linke party.
Michael Grosse-Brömer, the first secretary of the CDU’s parliamentary group, sought to allay fears the party was leaning towards either Die Linke on the left, or the AfD on the right. “There’s no wobble either to the left or the right,” he said, arguing the party had good reason to reject cooperation with either party, with both home to members who are under the watch of the domestic intelligence agency for extremist activity.
“Germany is served well neither by a socialist fug nor by rightwing extremists like Björn Höcke,” he said, referring to the AfD’s leader in Thuringia.
Earlier, the CDU premier of Schleswig-Holstein, Daniel Günther, had said Die Linke was “not as bad” as the AfD. That claim was vigorously rejected by Paul Ziemiak, the CDU’s general secretary.
Meanwhile, a poll of German voters suggested almost half – 48% – believed it was inevitable that the AfD, which is already represented in all 16 states and is the main opposition in the Bundestag, will enter government within the next decade, against 29% who thought it was unlikely. Fifty-nine per cent said they did not want to see the AfD in a federal government, against 19% who said they found the idea acceptable, while 26% said its participation in a regional government was acceptable.
Wading into the debate, the former CDU premier of Saxony-Anhalt, Wolfgang Böhmer, warned his party that it ignored the rightwing populists at its peril.
“The AfD has won the support of an astonishingly large number of voters … If my CDU continues to ignore them, they will be pushed into the role of victim,” the 84-year-old told the newspaper group Redaktionsnetzwerk. “We cannot afford to create the impression that the democratic parties are offended because they are not winning the votes.”
Many, both in the CDU and beyond, hold the so-called WerteUnion – or Union of Values – a rightwing conservative grouping within the party, responsible for its current crisis. The group, which has an estimated 4,000 members, formed as an opposition force to Merkel’s centrist course, in particular her decision to allow hundreds of thousands of refugees into Germany in 2015. Unlike the rest of the party, it has not ruled out cooperation with the AfD. Leading members of the CDU have called for WerteUnion members to be excluded from the party.
But Alexander Mitsch, WerteUnion’s chairman, called the group “indispensable” for the CDU. “Without us the party would have no chance of winning any voters any more,” he told the broadcaster SWR."

Modern Germany is not the Weimar Republic. But many Germans have been drawing parallels between a recent political earthquake and one of the darkest points in their country’s history.
Last Wednesday, for the first time since the second world war, a state premier was elected in Germany with support from a far-right party – Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) – tearing apart a cordon sanitaire which for years forbade major parties from working with far-right politicians. In the East German state of Thuringia, a little-known politician from the liberal Free Democratic party (FDP), Thomas Kemmerich, was elected state premier, beating the leftist incumbent Bodo Ramelow by one vote. The result was made possible by an unspoken state-level alliance of politicians in the FDP, the centre-right Christian Democratic Union, and the far-right AfD.
This result is a stark illustration of the splintering of German politics
The reaction across Germany was immediate and furious. German chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the vote, calling it “unforgivable” and a “bad day for democracy”. On Saturday, she fired Christian Hirte, the government’s commissioner for eastern Germany, after he congratulated Kemmerich on his success. Comparisons with Adolf Hitler’s rise to power quickly emerged. Ramelow tweeted a quote by Hitler heralding the early electoral success of the Nazi party in Thuringia, and rejoicing in the fact that the governing parties in the state were “unable to form a majority without our participation”. The tweet, intended as a cautionary parallel, included a photo of Germany’s then president, Paul von Hindenburg, shaking hands with Hitler. Beside it was a photo of Kemmerich, following his election victory, shaking hands with Björn Höcke, the head of the AfD in Thuringia, a politician so far to the right that a court last year ruled he could be called a “fascist”.
The analogy was imperfect, but some parallels with the Weimar Republic resonate. During his ascent to power, Hitler was aided by conservatives who thought they could use him to retain their own fading influence. In Thuringia last week, conservatives – most notably members of Merkel’s CDU – cooperated with the AfD in a bid to exert their own diminished power.
On Saturday, amid extreme public pressure, Kemmerich resigned. The fallout since has been intense. Mainstream parties – particularly the CDU – are in disarray as they struggle to reach a consensus on what to do next in Thuringia, and to address their own waning electoral support. On Monday, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a CDU politician handpicked by Merkel in 2018 to be a successor, announced her intention to step down as leader of the party. Germany’s already weakened grand coalition – consisting mainly of Merkel’s CDU and the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD) – has been rocked.
For the AfD, Thuringia was a spectacular strategic coup: an example of how to tangibly wield its limited political power to disrupt German democracy. The chaos emanating from the state has been unfolding for months. In an election in Thuringia last October, support for the CDU and SPD plummeted. Die Linke, or the Left, the successor to the East German Communist party, came first with 31% of the vote. But it was support for the AfD that saw the greatest surge compared with the previous election, finishing second with 23.4%. This result – a stark illustration of the splintering of German politics – has made the formation of a government in Thuringia next to impossible.
That the AfD is strong in Thuringia, where Höcke leads the party, is particularly worrying. Höcke has railed against Holocaust remembrance and uses Nazi vocabulary, warning of “Volkstod,” a death of the Volk, through a “population replacement”. His wing of the party, known as Der Flügel, is currently on a watchlist for extremism. Years ago, Höcke was nearly ejected from the AfD for his views; today, he’s an increasingly powerful force within the party, and an embodiment of its radicalisation.
The greater scandal is that the AfD is winning over so many voters to begin with, particularly across swathes of the former East Germany. Isolating the party is imperative. But this alone won’t diminish the party’s political support. How can mainstream parties win back AfD voters without parroting its policies and rhetoric? Despite the outcry over Thuringia, few politicians seem able to answer this question – or even ask it.
Meanwhile, the AfD is attempting to weaponise the mainstream consensus around rebuilding the cordon sanitaire to amplify voters’ grievances with the political establishment. In recent days, AfD politicians have repeatedly accused Merkel and her allies of forcing out an elected state premier. Last week, Alice Weidel, the leader of the AfD’s parliamentary group, tweeted a rhetorical question: “Who is actually endangering democracy in this country?”
It’s now possible that a new election will be called in Thuringia. The AfD has proved adept at turning political tumult to its advantage, and recent events may help rally its supporters. With the centrist parties in disarray, few will be surprised if the AfD increases its share of the vote. What has happened in Thuringia may just be a worrying prelude for what is yet to come.

The year 2020 was meant to be a relatively quiet time in Europe’s largest economy.
With regular elections only scheduled for the city state of Hamburg, where the centre-left remains strong and the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party (AfD) is projected to get an underwhelming 7% share of the vote, Angela Merkel’s last full year in power promised to be a stable pathway into her political retirement. A good time to focus, at last, on urgent geopolitical challenges: Trump, China, the eurozone.
Instead, the decision by some delegates of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in eastern Germany to defy a party ban on cooperating with the AfD did not only lead to the resignation of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the chancellor’s designated successor, but also ripped up all existing plans for what Germany’s post-Merkel era might look like, or when it will start.
“It won’t be long now until we have fresh elections,” the former Social Democrat (SPD) deputy chancellor Sigmar Gabriel told the tabloid Bild on Monday. “We are currently witnessing the end of Germany’s second large big-tent party.”
<U+FEFF>In terms of strategy, the debate inside Merkel’s party over the coming months will be about whether the rise of the AfD is best dealt with by shunning the far right completely, or whether to countenance cooperations at regional levels – even if for now none of the contenders are likely to propose a power-sharing deal at federal level, as the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, did with the far-right Freedom party.
At the root of this debate, however, is also a wider problem about the unity of the conservative party that has governed and defined the country through 50 of the last 70 years. Merkel’s party in its present form is a post-reunification fusion of the western CDU, defined by staunch Rhineland Catholics such as its towering leaders Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, and an eastern offshoot that supported and voted with the Socialist Unity party in the de facto one-party state.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the CDU was swiftly fused into one party and its ideological inconsistencies covered over – but they could now come back to haunt it.
“Under Kohl, the CDU’s headquarters dealt with the remaining left-leaning tendencies of its eastern branches by parachuting in western Christian Democrats to head the party in the eastern states,” said Gero Neugebauer, a political historian at Freie Universität Berlin. “That strategy used to work – it no longer seems to work now.”
If the defiance of red lines by CDU politicians in Thuringia exposed Kramp-Karrenbauer’s lack of authority, her successor is likely to face similar tests of strength: in Saxony-Anhalt, where there are elections in June 2021, CDU leaders have already said they would consider forming a minority government with the AfD.
Some German commentators believe the only way for Kramp-Karrenbauer’s successor to gain the authority necessary to face such challenges is to not only step out of Merkel’s shadow, but to push her out of the sun altogether.
“All candidates who now step forward should really combine their candidacy with a call for fresh elections,” said Melanie Amann in Der Spiegel. “There are therefore only two logical ways out of the current impasse: in order to survive, the CDU will have to convince a chancellor with record-level popularity ratings to step down. Or this chancellor will have to step down out of her own accord.”
The future of the CDU also throws up speculation about possible coalition-building after the next election. The resurgent Green party, currently second in national polls, will be watching debates among conservatives closely to work out whether it can still consider forming the country’s first conservative-green coalition government without a Merkel figure as a moderating influence.
Katrin Göring-Eckardt, the Green party group leader in the Bundestag, warned Christian Democrats against veering to the right. “Let’s hope the CDU will show us that a Christian Democratic party won’t allow itself to be humiliated by an extreme-right AfD.”
The co-leader of the leftwing Die Linke party, Katja Kipping, bemoaned the demise of Kramp-Karrenbauer, saying she had “demarcated the CDU against the right and thus saved its soul”.
For the rest of this year the world will have to get used to an inward-facing Germany, unlikely to stray outside of its comfort zones."

Angela Merkel’s designated successor has announced she is not planning to run for the German chancellorship at the next federal election and plans to step down as leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), German media reported on Monday morning.
The surprise announcement comes in the middle of a major row over the centre-right party’s “firewall” against the far-right, after CDU delegates in eastern Germany defied the party headquarter’s ban on cooperating with the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, 57, won the contest to succeed Merkel as leader of the CDU in December 2018 and was seen as the candidate most likely to continue the current German chancellor’s centrist course.
But “AKK”, as she has come to be known in German media, has struggled to build a profile in Merkel’s shadow, even after doubling up as defence minister last July.
“I will not run for chancellor,” Kramp-Karrenbauer told a news conference in Berlin on Monday, adding that she had been building up to the decision for some time and that she made it “with the intention of strengthening the CDU”.
“In my view, this has no impact on the stability of the grand coalition,” she said, referring to the national coalition between Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats.
Questions over her control over an increasingly divided CDU returned to the fore last week, when politicians from the party’s branch in Thuringia voted with the AfD to oust the state’s premier Bodo Ramelow, from the leftwing Die Linke party.
Merkel’s unusual decision to intervene in the affair, announcing that it was “unforgivable” for democratic parties to win majorities with the help of the AfD, accentuated Kramp-Karrenbauer’s lack of authority.
Kramp-Karrenbauer’s standing was further diminished when the CDU’s Thuringia branch defied her call to dissolve the state parliament and call a fresh election.
On Monday morning news magazine Der Spiegel reported that Kramp-Karrenbauer had cited the unclear positions of certain elements in her party towards the AfD and Die Linke as the reason for her resignation, and reiterated that she was against cooperations with both parties.
Friedrich Merz
The 63-year-old lawyer left politics for the financial industry about a decade ago, but stepped down from his role at asset manager Blackrock last week, saying he wanted to get ""more politically involved"" in the future.
Having been ousted as parliamentary leader of the CDU by Merkel in 2002, many have said he has never forgiven the chancellor, though he has downplayed the idea of any lasting resentment towards her.
Merz has built up a personal fortune of millions, including two private jets, which has caused controversy, particularly after he claimed that he remained a member of the middle class.
He promises to return the CDU to its former strong position. He says he can win back millions of voters who drifted to the AfD and has presented himself as more liberal than in the past on issues such as gay marriage
Jens Spahn
Still aged only 39, the youngest member of Merkel’s fourth cabinet has in the past portrayed himself first and foremost as a critic of the chancellor’s refugee policy, calling it “the white elephant in the room”.
But his stint at the health ministry has revealed a new side to the ambitious and energetic politician, who has fought to introduce policies that weren't a natural fit with his previous free-market conservative profile, such as compulsory measles vaccinations for children.
He is married to his long-term partner Daniel Funke, the editor of society magazine Bunte.
Armin Laschet
A staunch defender of Merkel's migration policy and an uncompromising critic of the AfD, Laschet holds a natural position of authority in the CDU as premier of the large state of North-Rhine Westphalia.
Laschet pulled off a coup by ousting the Social Democratic Party in this traditional centre-left stronghold in 2017.
Known as a moderate in policy terms, Laschet is also still relatively unknown at federal level.Markus Söder
A politician with a passion for dressing up for carnival in fancy dress (which in the past have included Shreck, Marilyn Monroe and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings), the 53-year-old Franconian used to have a reputation as a somewhat eccentric rabble-rouser.
But since being elected state premier in powerful Bavaria in 2018, Markus Söder has built a profile as a political operator who can do both folksy beer-hall speeches as well as sensible strategy-making, having voiced support for environmental protection schemes in the wake of the rise of Fridays for Future.
His disadvantage? In 70 years of democratic elections in post-war Germany, there has never been a chancellor from the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the CSU.
Merkel said she accepted the resignation of her designated successor, who was previously a state premier in the Saarland on the border with France, while also letting it be known that she would like AKK to stay on as defence minister.
“I regard this decision with the deepest respect, though I also have to say I greatly regret it,” Merkel told a news conference on Monday afternoon. “I can imagine this wasn’t an easy decision for her and I thank her for being prepared to stay on to steer the process of choosing a successor.”
The vacant seat at the top of Germany’s most powerful party since 1945 opens up a debate over the country’s political direction of travel in the post-Merkel period.
At least four frontrunners present themselves. Armin Laschet, the 58-year-old state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia and a staunch defender of Merkel’s refugee policy, would be the candidate most likely to continue the outgoing chancellor’s steering of the CDU in the centre of the political stream.
By contrast, the anointment of veteran rightwinger Friedrich Merz, who lost out to Kramp-Karrenbauer in the race for the party leadership in 2018, would symbolise a departure from the Merkel era and a return to the CDU’s more traditionally conservative roots. Merz, who isn’t currently a member of the Bundestag but quit his role at asset manager Blackrock last week, has in recent months openly criticised Merkel’s “lack of leadership”.
Two other candidates are less easily categorised. Markus Söder, the state premier of Bavaria, hails from the CDU’s traditional more conservative sister-party, the CSU. But in recent years Söder has proved a canny and popular political operator who has emphasised his party’s environmental credentials and could prepare the party for a coalition with the Green party at a political level. During last week’s political earthquake in Thuringia, Söder was quickest to come out in condemnation of any form of collaboration with the far-right. On Monday he denied rumours he was considering the role.
Thirty-nine year old Jens Spahn used to have a profile as a Merkel critic but has mellowed since taking over the health ministry, and recently pitched his tent closer to the chancellor’s pragmatist camp, championing both “migration and patriotism” in an op-ed for the Guardian. Spahn came third in the 2018 leadership contest."

A German state premier elected with help from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland has announced he will step down, succumbing to widespread outrage across the country and condemnation from Angela Merkel.
A postwar consensus among established parties of shunning the far right was broken on Wednesday when Thomas Kemmerich won the election in the eastern state of Thuringia on the back of votes from the chancellor’s Christian Democratic Union and the aggressively nationalistic AfD.
The little-known Free Democrat (FDP) politician told German media on Thursday morning that he was right to have accepted the mandate, arguing that fresh elections would merely play into the hands of the far right and the far left.
By lunchtime, however, after a meeting with his party leader, Christian Lindner, Kemmerich had changed his mind. “Resignation is unavoidable,” he said. “Democrats need democratic majorities.”
Merkel had waded into the affair earlier in the day, saying it was “unforgivable” that politicians from her centre-right party voted with the AfD to remove Thuringia’s leftwing premier, and that the outcome “has to be reverted”.
The outgoing state premier, Bodo Ramelow, from the leftwing Die Linke party, had emerged as the candidate with the strongest support in last October’s elections and had been widely expected to be sworn in to form a minority government in the third round of voting.
Instead it was Kemmerich, whose party had barely sneaked into parliament on 5% of the vote, who won the secret ballot by a single vote.
In a tweet sent on Wednesday afternoon, Ramelow drew attention to the fact that it was in Thuringia that Adolf Hitler’s Nazi party had first entered the German parliament and thus paved its path to power, 90 years ago almost to the week.
""Den größten Erfolg erzielten wir in Thüringen. Dort sind wir heute wirklich die ausschlaggebende Partei.[...] Die Parteien in Thüringen, die bisher die Regierung bildeten, vermögen ohne unsere Mitwirkung keine Majorität aufzubringen."" A. HitIer, 02.02.1930 pic.twitter.com/icDXFSKzC7
The AfD’s branch in Thuringia is dominated by the party’s aggressively nationalist wing. Last September a court ruled that the AfD’s state leader, Björn Höcke, could legally be termed a fascist, saying such a designation “rests on verifiable fact”.
Speaking during a state visit to South Africa, Merkel described the circumstances of Kemmerich’s election as “a singular process that broke with a fundamental conviction of mine and my party’s, namely that you don’t win majorities with the help of Alternative für Deutschland.”
What will happen next in Thuringia, a relatively small state with a population of 2.1 million, remains far from clear, however.
In a move that raises questions over CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer’s control over the party’s regional groups, its Thuringia branch on Thursday appeared to reject the possibility of fresh elections, saying it wanted to continue to work with Kemmerich.
Dissolving the state parliament will need a two-thirds majority – which would require votes from the CDU or the AfD. Kemmerich could call a vote of no-confidence instead, which would open the door to leftwing ex-premier Ramelow to be voted in after all. The Die Linke politician, who is seen as a moderate within the successor party of the East German Socialist Unity party, has made clear he remains available for the post.
Either way the political earthquake in Germany’s east has already done damage to the reputation of the two centre-right parties, Merkel’s CDU and the FDP, a pro-business party with liberal roots that used to be a natural junior coalition partner for the Christian Democrats.
Free Democrat leader Lindner, who walked out of coalition talks with the CDU and the Greens in 2017 saying it was “better not to govern than govern badly”, faces criticism from his members, several of whom have announced plans to cancel their membership on social media.
Having initially voiced his surprise at the outcome of the vote, some reports have since suggested that Lindner was explicitly warned that the AfD could use his candidate as a vehicle to gain political influence.
The AfD had fielded its own straw-man candidate in the anonymous third round of voting, without lending him any of its votes.
Lindner has announced an internal confidence vote over his leadership for Friday.
Merkel too appeared to criticise the FDP. She said Kemmerich gaining a majority only with the help of the far right had been predictable. “Therefore it has to be said that this process is unforgivable and the result has to be reverted,” she said.
The events in Thuringia were met with protests in several cities around the country, including Berlin, where about 1,000 people gathered outside the FDP headquarters. In Erfurt, protesters formed a human chain outside the parliament, chanting: “Who betrayed us? Free Democrats!”
Leading members of Germany’s “grand coalition” – forged between Merkel’s conservatives and the SPD in 2018 – are due to meet at the weekend to discuss the situation."

A flood of senior German politicians visiting the UK this week have been left confused and unnerved by the hardline rhetoric set out by Boris Johnson on trade talks, prompting warnings that the risk of a breakdown, or a no-deal Brexit, is as high as it has ever been.
Germany takes on the EU presidency in the second half of this year, and will have a crucial role in helping the European commission to steer the talks on a future UK-EU trading relationship to a successful conclusion by the end of the transition period in December.
There has been a consensus across German politics about the need to reach the closest possible relationship with Britain after Brexit. Senior German politicians have even been drafting a series of partnership offers to the UK on security, defence and foreign affairs, possibly wrapped up in a new Anglo-German friendship treaty.
But the hardline tone of Johnson’s recent speeches has thrown the German political class visiting London for a week-long symposium at the London School of Economics. The former trade minister Greg Hands was forced to reassure his German interlocutors that the British people did not want to set up a “Singapore-on-Thames”, and nor did Johnson.
But Ralph Brinkhaus, the parliamentary leader of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, said: “Within the next 11 months we have to decide what the common base of the relationship will be with the UK. We will compete. No question about that and no one is afraid of that. But we can have competition with cooperation or competition with conflict. Listening to the government’s speeches this week, I am not quite sure what the position is of the UK.”
Robert Habeck, the leader of the German Greens, and a potential German chancellor after next year’s elections, was also gloomy that a deal could be struck. He said: “Johnson has stated that under no circumstances does he intend to conduct the negotiations after 11 months. He has categorically ruled out extension of the negotiations. He does not want to accept the EU rules for work, environment, or the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. The EU, on the other hand, cannot accept tax or regulatory dumping on its doorstep and must protect its single market and insist on a level playing field. The risk of an unregulated no-deal Brexit is still high, and maybe has never before been higher.”
The anxiety was shared by Norbert Röttgen, the chair of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee and a member of Merkel’s party. “The question is whether we are listening to policy or rhetoric aimed at a domestic audience,” he said. “There is a danger on both sides that the intense rhetoric about principles gets emphasised time and again and so creates a reality of its own. The risk is that it gets difficult to switch to a different pragmatic response by the end of the year because that would mean losing face.”
He suggested the scale of the negotiations, and the apparent differences between the two sides on issues such as regulatory alignment and the European court of justice, meant a full deal would be unachievable by the end of the year. “The rhetoric will continue through the summer on both sides, but the people that are working on the technical stuff will try to do their job.” He said an initial deal might be reached by November “covering security, and those trade areas that are vital to limit mutual damage”. But he predicted that such a deal would have leave out a significant proportion of trade that would then have to be negotiated further on a sectoral basis in a process freed of artificial time limits.
The choice for both sides, he said, was between mutual self-harm and a cooperative relationship.
Asked in March 2016 how Germany would react if Britain left the EU, Wolfgang Schäuble, the current Bundestag president, said: “We will cry.” The tears have been shed, but the angst remains."

The civil war may yet escalate
Let’s all be good. This was, in essence, the conclusion of the conference in Berlin this month which aimed to at least begin the work of ending a war which has cost thousands of lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of people in Libya. Participants agreed that foreign meddling should cease and that everyone should abide by the UN arms embargo.
Despite the desperate need for peace, there was good reason to be cynical. The host, Angela Merkel, argued publicly with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, over what had actually been agreed. Fighting soon raged again. The UN refugee agency announced on Thursday that it is suspending all operations at a facility in Tripoli and moving refugees from the site, fearing for their safety and that of its staff and partners amid worsening conflict. The UN says that several participants in the Berlin meeting have since shipped both arms and mercenaries to Libya, blatantly violating the embargo.
The hypocrisy was never more evident than when Emmanuel Macron lambasted Mr Erdogan for failing to keep his promise to end interference, complaining about the dispatch of Turkish warships and Syrian mercenaries. Ankara supports the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), led by Fayez al-Sarraj – which has granted Turkey the right to search for gas off Libya. Strangely, the French president failed to mention the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, enthusiastic buyers of French arms and chief backers of the warlord Khalifa Haftar. His Libyan National Army advanced on Tripoli last spring while the UN secretary general was in the country for talks intended to pave the way to elections. Russia has sent in mercenaries to aid the general, while also attempting to maintain relations with the GNA. But France has also given him, at the very minimum, political backing. Donald Trump appeared to give him the green light for his April offensive with a phone call, and the US joined Russia to block a UK-backed resolution calling for him to end it, even if Washington has since wavered.
A population which endured decades of Muammar Gadaffi’s dictatorship has suffered turmoil since his ousting in 2011 by rebels with Nato support. But the folly and danger of believing that a strongman will bring “stability” has been documented too many times. To think that General Haftar is the answer is not only shameful but bizarre. Despite his authoritarianism, he is hardly strong: he is a 76-year-old man who has faced serious health issues, has failed repeatedly to make the advances he expected even with extensive foreign support, and few believe that his forces will remain united after him. Yet it has been made amply clear to him that he can continue to do as he wishes. Meanwhile the proxy war grows ever more complex and febrile. The influx of Turkish support is in part a response to Russian actions. The UAE seems to be stepping up its role because it fears being cut out by a deal between Russia and Turkey.
Europe has every reason to seek stability in Libya – especially so given the way that al-Qaida and Islamic State have benefited from chaos there, and the desperation to halt refugee flows, whatever the human cost. While it should increase pressure on France to rein in General Haftar and his backers, the toothless outcome of Berlin showed that the west has no intention of getting tough. Outside players are escalating their support for the warring parties, who have seized the opportunity to improve their military positions. The conflict will continue to intensify while foreign powers see only commercial and strategic rewards for their interference. The people of Libya will keep paying the price."

World leaders seeking an enduring ceasefire in Libya have agreed at a summit to impose sanctions on those breaking an arms embargo and are considering whether to send a multinational force to the country.
The conference in Berlin of 11 countries was aimed at bringing an end to the fighting between the UN-recognised government in Tripoli led by the prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, and the Libyan National Army in the country’s east led by Gen Khalifa Haftar.
While both sides to the conflict have agreed to nominate five members to an UN ceasefire monitoring committee, they are still far apart and not yet willing to negotiate directly.
The presidents of Russia, Turkey and France joined other global leaders at the talks hosted by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and held under the auspices of the UN.
The summit’s main goal was to get foreign powers wielding influence in the region to stop interfering in the war – be it through weapons, troops or financing.
Eleven countries, including the key players of France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Egypt, Russia, the US and the UK, attended, as well as António Guterres, the UN secretary general, in the biggest show of international attention on Libya for many years.
Speaking at the conference, Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, suggested some kind of international peacekeeping force was on the table. “If there is a ceasefire, yes, of course there’s a case for us doing what we do very well, which is sending experts to monitor the ceasefire.”
But he added he did not yet see a ceasefire, and as he spoke there were reports of air raids in Tripoli and further enforced closure of oil installations by tribesmen trying to influence the conference’s outcome.
The Italian and German defence ministers both said they were willing to send troops but only under a clear UN mandate.
The Berlin conference was largely designed to discourage external actors from turning Libya into a battleground for rival countries backing either side in the civil war. Both have been bolstered by arms, mercenaries or cash sent from abroad.
Russia, Jordan and the UAE have all been providing military support to Haftar, while Turkey has come to the aid of the Sarraj government, most notably by sending Syrian rebel fighters to defend Tripoli.
Forces loyal to Haftar have shut off production at all Libya’s major oil fields, an escalation that threatened to strangle the country’s finances. In a sign of the difficulties Sarraj and Haftar did not directly meet in Berlin. Guterres admitted he was very worried at the shutdown of oilfields and several of the country’s oil ports.
Stressing the high stakes, the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: “We have to make sure Libya doesn’t become a second Syria.”
There are serious concerns that signatories to the summit’s declarations will do little to abide by the agreements.
A lengthy statement prepared for the conference vowed that renewed UN sanctions would be enforced on any country breaching the arms embargo. It also called for a durable ceasefire, demobilisation and disarming of militias, talks to form a single government, a fair distribution of oil resources, a group of experts to advise on the Libyan economy and free elections to endorse the new government.
A UN-led international follow-up commission will be charged with tracking progress on the conference commitments.
The communique makes no mention of a peace monitoring force but does refer to technical committees to monitor the ceasefire.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, told the conference that the presence of Syrian and other foreign forces in Libya must end immediately. Russia is also accused of sending mercenaries to support Haftar’s forces.
Different peace conferences over the past two years in Paris, Rome, Moscow and Abu Dhabi have not produced enduring solutions.
The latest round of fighting broke out in April 2019 when Haftar tried to seize Tripoli by force days before a UN-brokered peace conference was about to start.
In a key meeting before the formal summit, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, met the UAE foreign minister, Abdullah bin Zayed, to impress on the UAE the need for an end to all foreign intervention in Libya.
On Saturday, Merkel also met the UAE’s true decision-maker, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Zayed. Prince Mohammed said he could not attend the conference, where there was likely to be criticism of the UAE’s role in arming Haftar and providing extensive air support.
The conflict has been made more complex by Turkey’s determination to extend its gas drilling rights in the eastern Mediterranean.
In return for its offer to help Sarraj militarily, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Libya to extend Turkey’s drilling rights – a move that has infuriated other countries including Greece and Cyprus.
A group representing southern Libyan tribesmen said on Sunday it had closed the southern El Shahara and El Feel oilfields, virtually halting all of Libya’s oil output."

It’s Davos time again. The global elite are packing their best snow boots and smartest woolly hats and firing up the Learjet for their annual pilgrimage to the World Economic Forum (WEF).
This year will mark the 50th gathering since the first “European Management Symposium” was held in the Swiss ski resort in 1971. The brainchild of economist-engineer Klaus Schwab, it was more modest back then – just 450 academics and business leaders discussed the state of the world, for a fortnight, without a political leader or celebrity in sight.
This year, nearly 3,000 people from 117 countries will attend, including 53 heads of state or government. The wealthiest or most important will sweep in by helicopter and private limo, the rest will chug through snow-drenched pine forests on the train.
On the agenda are four days of meetings, networking, speechifying and partying, overshadowed by an escalating climate emergency, a subdued global economy and a polarised world.
The WEF sees itself as “a partner in shaping history”. To critics, that’s an admission of guilt; they point out that Davos Man and Woman have made quite a mess of the world economy.
But Schwab himself is unbowed. Still fully engaged with his project at the age of 81, he’ll be holding bilateral meetings with world leaders and business chiefs through the week.
Schwab – born in Ravensburg, Germany, and now earning an annual salary of SFr1m, or £790,000 – has hosted nearly every major political and business figure going; Mandela, Clinton, Blair, Chirac, and Xi have all made the trip over the decades. Back in 1979, the former UK prime minister Edward Heath even conducted the Zurich Chamber Orchestra there.
There have been successes, notably Greece and Turkey agreeing to reconcile in 1988, and failures – such as in 2001, when a meeting between Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat didn’t create a breakthrough in the Middle East.
And there have been protests. Lots. For 20 years, anti-globalisation demonstrators have been trying to outfox the rigid security and machine gun-toting police in Davos to express their anger at the failings of capitalism.
This year’s theme is the vague-but-worthy “Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World”. It harks back to Schwab’s idea in 1971 that managers have a duty to customers, suppliers and the wider economy, not just dividend-hungry shareholders. It is also the WEF’s way of saying that the world economy is neither cohesive nor sustainable; populism is unravelling the global order as the climate emergency rages. As the former prime minister of Finland, Alexander Stubb, puts it, we face a “new world disorder”.
Schwab’s idea in 1971 was that managers have a duty to customers, suppliers and the wider economy
Where there is discord … enter Donald Trump. The US president is returning to Davos with a large delegation, including his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner. Trump will give the first keynote speech, on Tuesday – a chance to brag about his trade deal with China, and perhaps redirect his tariff aim towards the EU. But Trump won’t get all the limelight. The climate activist Greta Thunberg is also in town, and could unleash another death stare at the US president for failing to address the climate crisis.
The German chancellor Angela Merkel, European commission president Ursula von der Leyen, and Chinese vice-premier Han Zheng are all speaking – as is Iraq’s president, Barham Salih, whose views on the US-Iran crisis will be closely watched.
Business chiefs will be comparing notes about Brexit, while Prince Charles is taking a break from Megxit with a trip to Davos to speak on “saving the planet”. The Indian actress Deepika Padukone will collect a WEF crystal award for her work on mental health, while the US rapper will.i.am will talk about ending gun violence.
The Davos big tent increasingly resembles a wedding marquee for an odd couple with incompatible families. On one side, Croesus-rich bosses and mighty world leaders. On the other, activists, the heads of charities and non-government organisations and the odd celebrity with a cause.
Schwab’s message is that businesses need to do better, and “actively contribute to a more cohesive and sustainable world”. But despite his best efforts to heed the critics of globalisation, there will be protests this week. One group plans to march up to Davos from Landquart, over 40km away. Their message – the chief executives in Davos should resign and take the WEF with them.
Some in the financial markets will roll their eyes at the warm words, and chilling prophecies, that will echo in the Swiss mountains this week.
“The reality is that for all the heat and light, to paraphrase William Shakespeare, it will probably be much ado about nothing,” predicts Michael Hewson of CMC Markets.
But don’t rule out a tempest, if Trump and Thunberg should meet in the Davos corridors."

Angela Merkel’s government is coming under increasing pressure to spend some of its record budget surplus on tax cuts and investment in Germany’s ageing infrastructure.
Despite months of weakening economic growth, the German state had a surplus of €13.5bn (£11.6bn) of income over expenditure at the end of 2019, thanks to increased tax revenues and a low interest rate.
On Tuesday a banner headline in the Bild newspaper read “Chancellor, Hand Out the Money!” summing up the mounting cries by economists, commentators and lobbyists for the government to abandon its obsession with balancing the books – known colloquially as the Schwarze Null or black zero – and to use the money to invest in much-needed infrastructure projects across the country, as well as to reduce income tax levels.
The government on Tuesday signed a multibillion investment deal with the national rail network, Deutsche Bahn, to which the government will contribute €62bn, and the company €24bn.
But critics said much of the money, which was announced last year, would be insufficient to make up for years of neglect.
By comparison, the most recent projections of the costs of Britain’s High Speed 2 project are £88bn.
Across Germany, the strains of underinvestment in everything from school buildings to bridges, parks and town halls is growing increasingly visible. A lack of infrastructure in rural areas, including a failure to address digital technology, is contributing to economic decline and forcing people to move away.
In her almost 15 years in office, no Merkel government has ever reduced the tax bill. In 2007 the chancellor presided over a VAT rise of 3% to boost the ailing economy.
An editorial in Bild reminded Merkel how she had once promised to reform German tax laws and relieve the taxpayer but instead, in her 5,167 days in office had only ended up increasingly burdening them. The average tax rate – 19.7% when she came into office in 2005 – has risen to 23.2%.
On top of the €13bn at the finance minister Olaf Scholz’s disposal, he has a further €5.5bn that was set aside during the refugee crisis of 2015.
Announcing the surplus, Scholz said: “We had a bit of luck, but of course this is also down to our good economic management.”
He has categorically dismissed the idea of lowering the tax rate and has rejected plans to reduce the so-called solidarity tax, payable from all German incomes to finance the almost 30-year-old German reunification project.
Meanwhile, the issue of what to do with the surplus is causing open rifts within the government. The economics minister, Peter Altmaier, is reported to have concrete plans to reduce corporate tax and to get rid of the solidarity tax, or Soli as it is known.
The president of Germany’s taxpayers’ association, Reiner Holznagel, said it was time Germans saw something of the surplus. “This overhang of billions of euros obliges Scholz and Altmaier to bring forward the end of the Soli completely,” he said.
Marcel Fratzscher, head of the German Institute for Economic Research, likened tax cuts to distributing water with a watering can “that would be the worst thing the government could do with this excess”.
He added: “We should be clear that these immense surpluses despite shaky economic growth are very lucky and a chance that should not be lightly given away. The need for investment in infrastructure, education, digitalisation and climate protection is overwhelming. What the government needs to do is to come up with a clear and long-term plan which will make the German economy fit for the future.”
The Green party, as well as some members of Merkel’s own Christian Democrats, are pushing for surpluses to be invested in climate friendly technologies and climate shares, which would connect economic growth more directly to climate protection."

The world is still skeptical that after nearly three years in office Donald Trump will do the right thing on foreign affairs, according to new polling from the Pew Research Center.
The survey was conducted well before Trump signed off on a US drone strike that killed Qassem Suleimani last week. The strike has pushed tensions between America and its longtime Middle Eastern nemesis to high alert and led to Tehran launching ballistic missiles at two Iraqi military bases that house American troops.
Majorities of people in many of the 33 nations surveyed by the nonpartisan research center disapprove of a number of the policies that Trump talks about most often, including slapping tariffs on imported goods as a way to gain leverage in trade disputes, withdrawing from international climate change agreements, building a wall on the US-Mexico border and putting tougher restrictions on immigration to the US.
Similarly, across the 33 countries, more people disapprove than approve of Trump’s decision to have the US be the only world power to back out of a nuclear agreement with Iran.
A brighter spot for Trump, however, is the direct negotiations he has had with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. That effort won the most support, though not a majority in most countries surveyed.
Trump and Kim have held three rounds of talks about denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, most recently last year at the demilitarized zone separating North Korea and South Korea.
Sentiment against Trump is common across western Europe, where roughly 75% or more of people in Germany, Sweden, France, Spain and the Netherlands lack confidence in the US leader.
That feeling runs even deeper in Mexico, where 89% have no confidence in Trump, who has made Mexicans the target of his barbs and anti-immigration policies like the border wall.
But the world isn’t entirely against Trump.
Majorities in Israel, the Philippines, Kenya, Nigeria and India have confidence that he will do the right thing on the world stage.
Five leaders were rated in the poll, with Trump receiving the most negative views. Low shares expressed confidence in Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping as well.
Confidence in Germany’s Angela Merkel was the highest among the leaders. Views of France’s Emmanuel Macron were slightly more positive than negative.
Trump, a Republican, treats his relatively low approval on the world stage like a badge of honor. He told supporters during a December campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, that Germany and France like his predecessor, Barack Obama, a Democrat, more than they like him.
“If I ever become more popular that means I’m not doing my job,” he said.
The survey of nearly 37,000 people in the 33 countries was conducted from 18 May to 2 October 2019, based on telephone and face-to-face interviews.<U+FEFF>"

In early December, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel sat down opposite each other in Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant at the Savoy Hotel, central London, for a two-hour tête-à-tête dinner. They had some talking to do.
Cordial and constructive, diplomats in Paris and Berlin said, the evening apparently cleared the air. But it will take more than a dinner to clear the structural obstacles to a relationship that is critical to what Europe can achieve in 2020.
“The Franco-German relationship is the single most important relationship in the EU and it’s in a totally toxic condition,” said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “And it’s going to get worse before it gets better.”
There was always going to be a yawning gulf between the styles of Macron, 41, an ambitious, impatient and at times arrogant first-time French president, and Merkel, a cautious, pragmatic, consensus-building fourth-time German chancellor. But if, on matters of substance, their overarching visions coincide more often than they diverge, the two leaders’ very different domestic situations have compounded their personal differences, making the relationship unproductive – or worse.
Macron, halfway through his mandate at the Élysée Palace and revelling in powers that are not far short of royal, is increasingly frustrated, not just with Merkel’s slow pragmatism, but with her weakened authority since announcing she would not run again when her term ends in 2021.
Worse, her grand Christian Democrat-Social Democrat coalition is divided, bent mainly on survival and frightened even to consider fresh elections in which it would be challenged by the surging popularity of the nationalist Alternative für Deutschland party (AfD) on the right and the Greens on the left.
“Germany is in political paralysis, incapable of taking a major decision, and will probably remain so until elections in September 2021,” said François Heisbourg of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Hence Macron’s frustration: France has ideas; Germany is sticking its fingers in its ears.”
The makeup of Germany’s current coalition would anyway prove problematic for the French president, who himself faces re-election in 2022: the centre-left SPD dislikes his proposals on developing the EU’s military and security capability, while the conservative CDU opposes his plans for the eurozone and economic integration.
“Macron basically bet the farm on building a new relationship with Germany, reforming France and working with Berlin to reform Europe,” Leonard said. “He appointed German-speaking ministers and spent his first year wooing the Germans – but nothing materialised. So he pivoted.”
This year, Leonard said, the French president – currently trying to push through contested pension changes at home – has “not hung around for Berlin, or even shied away from upsetting it. His approach has been to launch his initiatives, try to build relationships with other countries, and involve the Germans later. It hasn’t gone down very well.”
Others, too, have been annoyed by Macron’s tendency to act first and consult later: the French president has, often alone, insisted on a shorter article 50 extension; imposed his line-up for Europe’s top jobs; vetoed EU accession talks for North Macedonia; and demanded, with the aim of keeping Russia out of China’s clutches, “a new architecture of trust and security” with Moscow.
But Berlin in particular has been vexed, culminating – after Macron told the Economist that Nato was “brain dead” – in Merkel reportedly informing her French counterpart, at an anniversary dinner commemorating the fall of the Berlin Wall, that she understood his “desire for disruptive politics” but was “tired of picking up the pieces”. Hence the Savoy dinner.
The picture is not entirely bleak. Away from the headlines, steady, day-to-day bilateral work continues. Berlin and Paris are still pushing ahead where possible, albeit incrementally.
German-French cooperation was “like two sides of an accordion”, a German diplomat said. “Sometimes you pull it apart a bit, then both sides come back together again. Each side knows they are joined to each other. And they know they can only produce a nice sound together.”
The Franco-German relationship “is certainly not in crisis”, said Heisbourg. “But in a way, it would almost be better if it was, because then we would have a real discussion, and the chance of decisions and some substantive action.”
Heisbourg added that Germany’s EU presidency, in the second half of the year, “for which Berlin surely will want to achieve something concrete”, might yet produce some progress. But Leonard was less sure.
At root, he said, the problem was structural: most French voters think neither France nor Europe is working very well for them, so Macron has “no alternative but to be an agent of change and disruption”; most Germans reckon things are going pretty well, so Merkel has the opposite imperative.
“Why this matters,” Leonard said, “is because while it’s true that France and Germany can no longer set the EU agenda and just expect all the others to follow, if there is no consensus between Paris and Berlin, really, nothing is possible.”
Ever since the 1950s, the relationship between France and Germany, the continent’s economic powerhouse and its diplomatic and military leader, has been the EU’s engine: when it works, Europe moves forward; when it doesn’t, Europe stalls.
The EU’s big decisions in 2020 – its new budget, eurozone reforms, carbon neutrality, digital taxation, relations with Russia – would be difficult even if France and Germany could agree and were prepared to act, Leonard said. “If they can’t and they’re not, it’s going to be very, very difficult indeed.”"
"14";"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/12/ukraine-russia-emmanuel-macron-angela-merkel";2019-12-12;"Could peace in eastern Ukraine finally be at hand?";"A meeting involving Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and the Russian and Ukrainian presidents has raised hopes
On Monday, half a decade into the conflict in eastern Ukraine, Vladimir Putin sat down with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Accompanied by Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, they had some reason to declare their meeting a success.
The four may not have brought immediate peace to the region, but they agreed to a complete ceasefire, further disengagement, de-mining, stepped-up monitoring by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and a full “all-for-all” exchange of prisoners by the end of the year. All four reaffirmed their commitment to the Minsk Agreements of 2014-2015, a roadmap to peace whose implementation stalled in the face of Moscow and Kyiv’s different interpretations of its components and sequencing. As part of an effort to unfreeze Minsk, Ukraine pledged to incorporate the “Steinmeier formula”, which promises elections in the parts of eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed forces, in a new law on status for those territories. This might not sound like much, but after years of deadlock, the first of these meetings since 2016 represents progress.
Of course, the ultimate success or failure of Monday’s meeting will not be measured by the agreements reached. What matters is whether Ukraine and Russia have the capacity and the will to implement them – and what comes next. Ceasefires have been promised before. A special status law was passed under Zelenskiy’s predecessor, Petro Poroshenko. For this time to be different, the shooting has to stop and Ukraine must develop a clear path to bring the breakaway region back into the fold.
That won’t be easy. Ukraine, which did not start this conflict, faces a choice between continuing to fight a war that kills soldiers and civilians, and the challenging task of reclaiming a region and a population after five years of fighting, mistrust and what increasingly feels like a border cutting the country in two.
While reclaiming the territory and its people is ostensibly what this war has been about, some Ukrainians believe a formal acceptance of the status quo, with the conflict frozen and the territory effectively lost, at least for now, is an acceptable solution. As Zelenskiy negotiated in Paris, protesters in Kyiv stood ready to reject anything he might agree to as capitulation. The opposition to the president is coming from politicians and activists concerned that their new leader is ramming through ill-planned policies, from veterans of the war, and from noxious rightwing groups that threaten armed violence.
Zelenskiy has made all of these groups nervous since he took office in May and started to take steps towards the peace he promised in his election campaign. In October, he vowed to disengage forces at three locations, and publicly accepted a version of the Steinmeier formula. This set out a road map for elections in the east paired with the entry into effect of the region’s autonomous status within Ukraine. Zelenskiy added a caveat, insisting that Ukraine should have control before elections could be held. But his avowal of the overall concept reassured Moscow and paved the way for Monday’s talks.
Uncertainty over Zelenskiy’s path to peace is probably one reason he has dropped in the polls. Where he once enjoyed the support of nearly three-quarters of Ukrainians, today just over half think he is doing a good job. While his waning popularity presents challenges, the bigger risk, both to reconciliation and to Ukraine’s overall political stability may come from unrest driven by his adversaries. On Monday, however, this was modest: the protesters in Kyiv dispersed after the press conference, satisfied that their leader did not, in fact, surrender to Moscow.
Zelenskiy is in a decent position to deliver on his promises. He can strengthen his hand by reaching out to the people of eastern Ukraine and reassuring those who live there and those displaced by the conflict that he sees them unequivocally as Ukrainians – something he reiterated on Monday.
But he can’t do it alone. He needs Putin to do his part. Historically, Moscow has argued that it cannot negotiate on behalf of the self-proclaimed leaders it backs in eastern Ukraine. Instead, it wants them at the table with Kyiv. This means that if prisoner exchanges don’t happen, ceasefires don’t hold, and OSCE monitors remain constrained in their movement, Moscow can say that it’s not responsible.
But if Russia’s negotiating position has remained hardline, the Kremlin has much to gain from an end to the war. Over the last five years, EU member states have demonstrated that they need signs of progress to ease or lift the sanctions they imposed on Russia when the conflict began. Keeping de facto statelets afloat in east Ukraine is expensive, and peace means representation in Kyiv for Russian-speaking eastern Ukrainians. Progress on peace would ease the path to the gas deal with Ukraine that Moscow needs to maintain its exports to the rest of Europe. As for claims that it cannot speak for its proxies, their existential dependence on Russian military and financial support gives Moscow substantial leverage, which it has exercised in the past. If Moscow decides it wants peace, it can deliver it.
The four leaders plan to meet again in four months. Assuming that happens, they will then have to start talking properly about the steps needed to make Minsk, and peace, a reality: elections, control of the border and amnesties. The coming months will be a test: if the parties do actually implement what they agreed this week there will be far more cause for optimism that this conflict can finally come to an end.

"15";"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/11/defence-industry-hijack-eu";2019-12-11;"Why are we letting the defence industry hijack the EU?";"NA
For three years now, the European Union, created to promote peace and understanding, has been undergoing a profound pivot to militarisation and hard power. Europeans are served up a relentless narrative about their continent’s duty to stand up to external challenges: Russian assertiveness, the US retreat from Nato and traditional Euro-Atlantic structures and China’s rise as a geopolitical force. But this narrative has served to legitimise a militarising agenda that, away from the spotlight, is being set and pushed by defence industry interests and their political cheerleaders.
Countries in Scandinavia and central and eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, Poland, Romania, Finland and Sweden, have all increased military expenditure as part of this creep towards arming and organising for potential use of lethal force. Major western European countries have kept the annual military spending-to-GDP ratio stable, but at least four are consistently among the biggest military spenders in the world. Last year, France spent €57.2bn (£48bn), Germany €44.4bn, Italy €25bn and Spain €16bn. In the UK, defence spending topped €50bn. As a comparison, Russia, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute database, spent €55bn. The vast sums being devoted to maintain and build up the military capacity of individual EU countries come at a time when, with Brexit and the rise of nationalism in former iron curtain countries, the EU itself has never appeared so weak.
Indeed, it was in answer to this perceived weakness that the outgoing European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, in November 2016 presented his European defence action plan, the centrepiece of which was the reinvigoration of the EU’s defence industry. As a result of this process, which has in effect been hijacked by defence industry lobbyists, a European defence fund (EDF) and a financial mechanism called the European peace facility were established. The first is intended to finance research and development, the second EU defence operations. The net cost to the EU budget comes close to €25bn, while the EDF could be complemented with tens of billions more from member governments.
France has been at the forefront of promoting a European defence union
The militarisation dynamic has spilled over into other policy sectors, including development aid and border control. An integrated border management fund and an internal security fund will make more billions available for national police and border guards, forces that look increasingly militarised. Frontex, the EU’s border and coastguard agency, which contributes to policing the Mediterranean for unwanted migrants, is turning into a €10bn super-agency. It is developing a 10,000-person standing corps and investing billions in infrastructure and hardware produced by military and hi-tech corporations, including drones and surveillance technology. The era of a Europe that led by example is coming to an end, replaced by hard power.
The EU deserves criticism for not making enough of this process transparent and accountable. The names of the experts advising the commission on which projects the EDF should finance should be public and the European parliament should not have voted away its right of oversight. Still, it would be a mistake to make Brussels the scapegoat. It is the competing national priorities of EU governments that are pushing the EU towards this militarisation.
France, which has the most aggressive arms export policy in Europe, has been at the forefront of promoting a European defence union. Not only has President Macron pushed this goal fervently since he came to power, he has also fought hard to keep a French hold over the commission’s internal market portfolio, which includes defence investments. Appointing Thierry Breton to the incoming five-year commission when European countries are increasing defence spending to match the 2% Nato target, Donald Trump’s favourite attack line against Europeans, was a coup for France. But Breton is a former CEO of Atos – a multinational with interests in the aerospace industry, among other sectors – whose appointment potentially creates a conflict of interest.
Last summer, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Germany’s defence minister and chair of the ruling CDU party, proposed that Germany meet its Nato spending pledge by 2024. Germany spends 1.2% of GDP on defence and such an increase would contribute an extra €30bn. There are indications, too, that Spain, Italy and the UK will also sign up to the coming intra-European arms race.
At Nato’s 70th anniversary celebrations last week, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, boasted that Europe and Canada had increased military spending by $130bn over the past five years; by 2024 the estimate is it will reach $400bn.
This arms race mentality is now being imbibed by some of most powerful people in Europe. In the Bundestag Angela Merkel recently urged parliamentarians to rethink Germany’s restrictive arms export policy to the Sahel. “We cannot train people who have to fight terrorists only to say it’s up to them to see where they get their weapons,” she argued, warning that Russia, China and Saudi Arabia would fill the gap. The bigger picture is that she cannot know where arms sold by the European defence industry will end up.
What is so worrying is that, even as spending is loosened and politicians who understand how the defence industry’s needs can be aligned with EU policy reach positions of power, few safeguards are being put in place. Scant or no public discussion has taken place and there is no oversight built into the new structures.
EU member states have enthusiastically supported this militarisation policy but refused any discussion of arms export policy. This is the elephant in the room; half of the world’s leading exporters of arms are EU states. They contribute to political destabilisation in regions such as the Middle East, north Africa and the Sahel, as well as the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. This is where Europe’s conversation needs to start. If the EU’s defence policy is being used to advance the needs of big producer countries and their industries it needs to tighten its regulations on the licensing and monitoring of arms exports and their enforcement.
This is an issue around which a progressive coalition aiming to challenge the hard power narrative can form. It’s a starting point for a discussion three years overdue.

Germany’s Social Democrats have confirmed two relatively unknown leftwingers as the new leaders of the party at the start of a three-day conference that will focus on its future in Angela Merkel’s grand coalition.
Saskia Esken, a digital policy expert, and Norbert Walter-Borjans, a former state finance minister, were confirmed as the first SPD leadership pairing in the party’s 156-year history in a verification vote on Friday. The conference, entitled New Era, also resurrected the party’s traditional symbol of a red rose.
The pair used their maiden speeches to pledge an intense dialogue with the Christian Democrats and their sister Christian Social Union party over the future of the coalition. They have called for improvements on welfare and environmental policies, as well as an end to the government’s commitment to stick to a balanced budget – the “black zero”.
But they strikingly rowed back from demanding a renegotiation of the coalition agreement with Merkel’s conservatives, or the withdrawal of the SPD from the government, despite having campaigned forcefully on that issue.
“It is time for an about-turn,” said Esken, calling for an end to the neoliberal labour policies introduced by the former leader Gerhard Schröder, the unpopularity of which many members cite as the reason for a dramatic erosion in the party’s support in recent years.
Walter-Borjans, who has been likened to Robin Hood for his battle against tax evasion, said it was time to loosen the German attachment to balancing the budget in order to invest in Germany’s ailing infrastructure, from schools and universities to its digital future, as well as clawing back control from financial markets. “It’s not democracy that should bow to the markets, rather the markets that should bow to democracy,” he said to warm applause.
Olaf Scholz, the finance minister, who lost out to Esken and Walter-Borjans in the leadership race, having been widely expected to win it along with his partner, Klara Geywitz, congratulated the couple, and said the party had no choice but to stick together if it hoped to claw back some of the many millions of voters the SPD had lost, mainly to the Green party and the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland over the past few years.
“A strong SPD is important because a society without us would be very different,” he said. “But we will only manage this if we stick together … and if we ensure we have a plan how to make it work.”
He said the party needed to recognise its achievements in government, including the introduction of a minimum wage and basic pension, which is in the process of passing through parliament.
The duo, nicknamed “Eskabo” by their supporters, have set themselves the ambitious task of increasing the SPD’s voter support twofold, from the current record low of 15%, within the next year.
Their threat to pull the SPD out of the government prematurely – new elections are not due until 2021 – caused Berlin’s political class to hold its breath over the past week, with political observers at home and abroad braced for an earlier than anticipated departure of Merkel, who has said she will not stand again.
Her conservative alliance has vehemently opposed the SPD’s idea of renegotiating the coalition agreement, which took six months to reach."

Angela Merkel has expressed “deep shame” during her first visit as German chancellor to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Holocaust memorial and vowed to fight rising racism and antisemitism in Germany and Europe.
Dressed in black, Merkel said the crimes committed at the site in southern Poland where the Nazis ran their largest death camp would always be part of German history.
“This site obliges us to keep the memory alive. We must remember the crimes that were committed here and name them clearly,” Merkel said during a ceremony also attended by the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki.
“I feel deep shame given the barbaric crimes that were committed here by Germans,” she added.
The German chancellor also pledged a donation of €60m (£51m) towards a fund to conserve the physical remnants of the site of the barracks, watchtowers and personal items of those who died, such as shoes, spectacles and suitcases.
Before her speech, Merkel and Morawiecki toured the camp’s crematorium where victims’ bodies were burned. They walked through the camp’s iron gate bearing the motto Arbeit macht frei (Work sets you free) and visited the barracks.
Since becoming chancellor in 2005, Merkel has paid her respects at other Nazi concentration camps, and has been five times to Israel’s Holocaust museum and Yad Vashem memorial.
Poland’s foreign ministry called her visit “historic” in acknowledgement of the unique status Auschwitz has in the world’s collective memory. The ministry also noted it was only the third visit to the camp of an incumbent head of a German government.
Helmut Kohl went there twice, in 1995 and 1989. Before him, Helmut Schmidt was the first to visit in 1977. Merkel has previously visited both Dachau – the first Nazi death camp – and Buchenwald, together with the former US president Barack Obama.
No official reason has been given as to why this is the first time in her 14 years in power that she had visited the most notorious of the Nazi death camps. But speculation is rife in Berlin that she was keen to do so ahead of the possible collapse of her government, after repeated threats from the incoming new leadership of her junior coalition partner the Social Democrats to withdraw from government.
A rise in the number of antisemitic attacks in Germany has led to pressure for her to take a symbolic stand, especially following a brutal attack in front of a synagogue in the central city of Halle two months ago, in which two people were murdered by an attacker claiming he was driven by antisemitic motives.
Josef Schuster, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, who is accompanying Merkel, along with Romani Rose, the chairman of the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma, said he welcomed her visit, calling it an “important signal at a time of a swing to the right” in Germany.
There is no other memorial site that so emphatically brings home the events of the Shoah than Auschwitz,” he said. Rose said that even 75 years after its liberation “the former Nazi death camp and the industrial mass murder that took place there still makes visitors shudder”.
Schuster has repeatedly warned of the dangers of Alternative für Deutschland, the leading opposition in the Bundestag, one of whose figureheads, Björn Höcke, has called for Germans to make a “180-degree” turn in the way they perceive their culpability in the Holocaust, and referred to the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin as a “monument of shame”.
A huge rise in the number of visitors, from about 1 million five years ago to 2.15 million last year, has posed a particular challenge, the memorial’s director, Piotr Cywinski, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, saying that visitors often tried to take home objects from the former death camp as souvenirs.
Nazi forces killed an estimated 1.1 million people at the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex during their occupation of Poland during the second world war. Most of the victims were Jews transported from across Europe to be killed in gas chambers. Tens of thousands of other people were killed there too, including Poles, Soviet prisoners of war and Roma. The camp was liberated by the Soviet army on 27 January 1945."

The new leftwing leadership of Germany’s Social Democrats have sounded a cautious note over hastening the breakup of Angela Merkel’s coalition government, dampening speculation that the troubled party could pull the plug on the government as soon as Friday.
In a surprise result, two little-known leftwingers, Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, caused an upset at the weekend when they won the leadership vote of the world’s oldest social democratic party, a move that seemed to signal a rejection of the party’s centrist “third way” phase initiated under the former chancellor Gerhard Schröder.
The result came as a shock not only to the widely expected winner, Germany’s deputy chancellor and finance minister, Olaf Scholz, but also to the victorious pair and their supporters.
The new leaders, both critics of the SPD’s “grand coalition” with Merkel’s centre-right party, had said throughout their leadership campaign that a decision on the future of the governing alliance would be made at this weekend’s party conference in Berlin.
But the latest draft for Friday’s main motion, agreed between Esken, Walter-Borjans, Scholz and the interim leader, Malu Dreyer, seems designed to put the break on a rushed exit by tasking the new leadership merely to “seek a dialogue” with Merkel’s CDU about measures to stabilise Germany’s slowing economy and amend an already agreed climate package.
The 67-year-old political economist who joined the SPD at the age of 31, has sometimes been referred to as Germany's Bernie Sanders for his insistence that the SPD must lead the country out of the ""neoliberal wilderness"". He has said the SPD had drifted into believing that lower taxes and VAT rises were the best way to run the country, and he would look to reverse this thinking, in the unlikely event he was elected co-leader.
The father of four who paints and sculpts in his spare time, earned a reputation as a risk taker willing to take on the rich and powerful during his time as finance minister in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany´s most populous state, when he paid €19 million for CDs containing whistleblower's data on thousands of Swiss bank clients. The move prompted tens of thousands to voluntarily pay back €7.2bn in unpaid taxes.
In an interview with the Guardian last month, Walter-Borjans - often referred to as NoWaBo for short - said the country was in need of a large amount of investment and that he would rather Germany abandoned its commitment to balancing the federal budget, the so-called ""black zero"", to free up money for this. ""If the economy does indeed enter a downturn then we will need to make massive investments. Because our infrastructure is not in a good state, and nor is our digital infrastructure nor our schools. We have to question the black zero.”
The 58-year-old from Baden-Württemberg is even less well known than her male counterpart. She joined the SPD at the age of 29, and has been in the Bundestag since 2013, taking a clear left-wing position, and like Walter-Borjans also critical of the SPD´s ""neoliberal"" politics under Gerhard Schröder, and voting against a tightening of the government's extradition policy, but has largely remained low-profile.
Married with three children, she counts among her hobbies woodland walks with her dog, as well as music and literature.
During the campaign as well as criticising the grand coalition, she made a particular point of stressing the need for reform of the European Union including introducing a Union-wide fiscal policy including cracking down on tax evasion.
In a move designed to mend relations between leftwing and centrist factions in the SPD, the Guardian understands the wording of the motion could lead to Scholz and other ministers being invited to join the talks.
Kevin Kühnert, the hoodie-wearing leader of the SPD youth wing, who is seen as one of the architects of Esken and Walter-Borjan’s shock victory, has also appeared to cool on the prospect of an exit from the grand coalition, known as “GroKo”.
“If you leave a coalition, you end up giving up a degree of control,” Kühnert told the Rheinische Post newspaper in an interview. “SPD delegates should bear that in mind too when they made up their mind.”
“If need be, I am not afraid to go into an election with the SPD in the next three months,” said Kühnert, who is in the running to be voted deputy leader at the weekend. But many party insiders question whether the leftwingers calling the shots have the right staff and action-ready strategy to go into fresh elections early next year.
Another reason why even seasoned GroKo critics are reluctant to bring down the current government is that it has yet to implement one the SPD’s totemic projects, a raising of the basic pension for low-income workers employed all their lives.
Yet the risk of a chaotic end to Merkel’s fourth term in office remains. Apart from formally voting in Esken and Walter-Borjans as new leaders, delegates could propose and pass a motion to ditch the government’s commitment to balanced budgets, the so-called schwarze Null (“black zero”).
A strongly worded motion committing SPD ministers to further spending could push the more fiscally conservative finance minister Scholz to throw in the towel, unravelling Merkel’s current cabinet.
Walter-Borjans told the Guardian in an interview last month that driving Germany to commit to more spending would be a defining issue of his leadership.
“If the economy does indeed enter a downturn then we will need to make massive investments. Because our infrastructure is not in a good state, and nor is our digital infrastructure nor our schools. We have to question the black zero,” said Walter-Borjans, a former finance minister of the state of North-Rhine Westphalia.
“If that doesn’t work with our coalition partner then that’s not a good sign.”"

Will it pay off?";"The country’s shifting political dynamics and the rise of the Greens has left the governing parties more vulnerable than ever
The newly crowned leadership duo of Germany’s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) has hardly had a great welcome. Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken beat the finance minister, Olaf Scholz, and his running mate, Klara Geywitz, by 53% to 45% in the final round of the membership votes. The response was vociferous: the imminent death of the SPD was the verdict from most of the German media.
To prefer two little known candidates over Scholz is a radical statement against the SPD's most popular politician
The vote certainly marks a significant turning point in German politics not just for the SPD but also for the government – in which the SPD is still a junior partner – and for the politics of the centre left.
To start with the SPD: the designated leaders have never held leadership positions within the party beyond the local level. Walter-Borjans, 67, was spokesperson of the regional government North Rhine-Westfalia, becoming the region’s finance minister between 2010 and 2017. Saskia Esken, 58, has been a backbench MP since 2013 without any office in the government or the party. Their campaign targeted the legacy of Gerhard Schröder’s 1998-2005 government as a sell-out of social-democratic values. They are also explicitly against the role of the SPD in the current federal government, a coalition they would like to end as soon as possible.
Their lead opponent, Scholz, 61, was a key supporter of Schröder’s New Labour approach. He won regional elections in Hamburg and is vice chancellor of Angela Merkel’s government. He ranks third in polls of politicians’ popularity, behind Merkel and the Green party leader Robert Habeck. To prefer two little-known candidates to Scholz is a radical statement by a majority of party members against their most powerful politician.
As with the heirs of Tony Blair in the UK, Germany’s supporters of New Labour did not succeed in forging solid support for their centrist approach. Instead, the party has spent the past 15 years fighting over the consequences of the Schröder years. During that time, it has had eight leaders, all of whom failed to resolve this dispute. The party was right to seek a new approach to find a new leader with a membership vote. Yet to open the leadership contest to the most inexperienced on the national stage was a big gamble for Europe’s most powerful country in politically uncertain times.
If and when the SPD resigns from the ruling coalition with Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), there will be many repercussions. The CDU has a similar leadership issue in that its new head, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, still has to prove herself to party rivals as worthy to be Merkel’s successor. A quick collapse of the government might wrong-foot the party and tempt her competitors into a new leadership challenge. Both big parties will now run with new leaders at the next election.
The inward turn of the SPD will give the already rapidly changing party system a further push. Both the CDU and SPD have lost dramatically during recent European and regional elections. The winners are the Green party and the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).
The Green party, also led by a new team since January 2018, is a clear beneficiary of the rise of the urban liberal middle class and the weakness of the two governing parties. The Green party is now solidly number two in the party system and highly likely to join the next government, either with the CDU or the two parties on the left.
After the last election in 2017, the CDU tried to form a coalition with the Green party, which only failed because the Free Democrats (FDP) chickened out. It became clear that both the CDU and the Greens have a considerable overlap in major areas including social policy, the digital transformation, taxation and even migration. Under the new imperatives of the climate crisis, the deteriorating public infrastructure and the slowdown of the German economy, there is a new political agenda focusing on exactly these issues. The similarity to the agenda of the newly elected president of the EU commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and her proposed European “green new deal” is no accident.
The SPD under its new leadership is unlikely to make a mark on the emerging discourse. Its commitment to fighting inequality, improving social protection and public investment has value: Germany is more unequal than it wants to admit. However, its battle is stuck in the past. Unless it manages to get both sides of the party out of the trenches and to take on new challenges with all its remaining strength, the SPD runs the risk of being swept away by new political dynamics.

The party’s new leaders can renew its appeal
August Bebel, one of the founders of the German SPD, liked to make a robust case for preserving clear blue ideological water between political parties. “If your opponent praises you, beware!” Bebel once said. “But if he gets stuck into you, you are usually on the right way.”
Last weekend a narrow majority of members of one of the world’s oldest democratic parties appeared to judge that sound advice. In electing two candidates from its left flank to lead it, the SPD’s grassroots have called time on a period of cooperation and consensus between the party and Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats. They may well have relished the furious verdict of conservative commentators, some of whom accused the party of lacking a sense of “national responsibility”, by jeopardising the CDU-SPD coalition government.
The surprise election of Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, both of whom are fierce critics of the coalition, indicated that for a narrow majority of SPD members, a tipping point has been reached. For 10 of the last 14 years, the country’s traditional centre-left powerhouse has been a junior coalition partner to the CDU, cleaving to the centre-ground and keeping Angela Merkel in office. During that time, support for the SPD has plummeted and it has found itself supplanted on the left of German politics. A poll this week saw its support plunge to 13.5%, compared with 21.5% for the Greens. Mr Walter-Borjans and Ms Esken were considered the underdogs in a runoff against the current minister of finance, Olaf Scholz, and his running mate, Klara Geywitz, who were backed by senior figures in the party. But against a backdrop of seemingly inexorable decline, members have opted for a clean break with the recent past.
This weekend the party will vote on whether to withdraw support for Mrs Merkel’s government immediately, possibly triggering a general election. With the party’s poll ratings at such a low ebb, that might be judged a step too far. But the new ideological direction of travel is bracingly clear. It resembles in many respects the journey that the Labour party has already taken in Britain. Mr Walter-Borjans and Ms Esken have vowed to lead the party and Germany out of what they have described as a “neoliberal wilderness”; their roadmap includes a new wave of investment in infrastructure, a higher minimum wage and more radical action on the climate emergency. In a significant break with German economic orthodoxy, they have also demanded an end to the so-called black zero doctrine, which commits governments to a balanced budget.
A new political era is coming in Germany. Mrs Merkel has said she will not contest the next election, after an unbroken period in office that began in 2005. The SPD’s decision to reposition itself on the left is not without risk, not least because of opposition among many of the party’s leading lights. But a moment of radical renewal was desperately required. In the 2005 federal election, which gave Mrs Merkel her first term in office, the SPD won 34.2% of the vote. The spiral of decline since then has been dizzying. Since senior figures in the CDU have sought to rule out any concessions to Mr Walter-Borjans and Ms Esken, the bid to win back the missing millions may begin sooner rather than later."

The prospect of early elections or a minority government in Germany has increased after leading politicians in the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) dismissed demands by the new leftwing leadership duo of their junior coalition partner to renegotiate the terms of their alliance.
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the head of the Christian Democrats (CDU), said the coalition deal with the Social Democrats (SPD) would either stay intact or the SPD would have to leave the government. It represented a challenge to the SPD’s new co-leaders, Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans, to decide whether or not they wanted to remain in power.
“We are not a therapy outfit for the respective coalition government parties,” she told the German public broadcaster ZDF.

During the campaign as well as criticising the grand coalition, she made a particular point of stressing the need for reform of the European Union including introducing a Union-wide fiscal policy including cracking down on tax evasion.
The government of Angela Merkel was committed to the coalition agreement that took six months to negotiate in 2017, Kramp-Karrenbauer said. “That’s what we’re concentrating on, and not on the sensitivities of the one or other coalition partner.”
Esken and Walter-Borjans secured first place in an SPD leadership vote on Saturday, on the back of a campaign centred largely on their opposition to the SPD’s participation in the coalition as it stands. Many in the party believe that governing in Merkel’s shadow has contributed to its poor showings in regional and European elections this year.
The SPD, which will officially appoint the new leaders at its party conference in Berlin on Friday, must now decide the direction it wants to take.
Esken and Walter-Borjans have also called for a move away from what they called the SPD’s neoliberal policies and for greater stress to be put on social justice. Among their demands are for the government to abandon its policy of sticking to a balanced budget, known as the “black zero”, and to invest €500bn (£430bn) in infrastructure, social welfare and tackling the climate emergency. They would also like to see a rise in the minimum wage from €9 to €12.
If the SPD abandons the government, Germany will either face new elections or the CDU will continue ruling as a minority government.
Analysts have dismissed an initial suggestion that the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), might try to reignite plans for a “Jamaica” coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens. So-called because the parties’ colours resemble those of the Jamaican flag, the coalition had been on the brink of being realised in 2017 before the FDP pulled out.
Riding high in the polls, the Green party would benefit more from new elections, and the FDP has long since ruled out governing with Merkel.
Markus Söder of the CSU said a coalition worked only if its partners communicated with each other, but “just because a party leader has been changed, this is no grounds for changing a coalition agreement … especially not if the demands made are purely ideologically motivated, and serve simply to cushion the blow of an election”.
Appealing to SPD members to stay in the government, he said: “We’ve reached half-time. And which team leaves the pitch after half-time?”
Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for Merkel, said she was prepared to talk to the SPD’s leaders, but rejected the idea of renegotiating the coalition deal. “The chancellor is principally ready for cooperation and a conversation, just as is usual in a coalition,” Seibert said.
Merkel, who has been Germany’s leader since 2005, has said she will not stand for another term. Early elections could therefore spell the premature end of her time as chancellor.
Esken and Walter-Borjans have faced the cameras on a range of prime-time political chatshows since their election on Saturday. Esken carefully avoided saying specifically whether the SPD would make official its threat to withdraw from the government. But she said she hoped the other side would be willing to talk. “It must be clear that there’s a readiness to talk,” she said, adding that it would then be “up to the party base to decide the result”.
Walter-Borjans was more forthright, saying the party had to be ready to walk away. “If the coalition partner takes the attitude to block new tasks, then the decision needs to be that it cannot go on.,” he said.
The SPD’s fiscal policymaker, Johannes Kahrs, said he believed the grand coalition would stay intact because it was for the good of the country. “I believe that both sides know that they must come to sensible results for this country,” he told the broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.
Carsten Linnemann, a CDU MP and head of the Mittelstands-Union, an association representing the interests of small to medium-sized businesses, which form the core of the German economy, warned against making too many concessions to the SPD. He rejected the party’s demands to abandon the “black zero”, saying: “If we go along with these demands, this would massively damage the CDU.”
Oskar Lafontaine, a former SPD leader and finance minister, predicted the party’s demise if it did not leave the government. Lafontaine turned his back on the party in 1999 in protest at the labour market reforms of his successor, Gerhard Schröder, which many leftwing members of the party say is the main reason for the SPD’s loss of voter support.
“If they continue to work with the CDU, they will collapse,” Lafontaine, who now represents the leftwing Die Linke party in Saarland, told Spiegel. The new SPD leaders, he said, had the chance “to commit to a politics in which social justice and peace are at the heart”."

The future of Angela Merkel’s government is in doubt after the election by her junior coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), of a new leftwing leadership duo who have pledged to renegotiate the terms of the alliance.
Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, from the left of the SPD, have called for major policy concessions from Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), and say they are prepared to pull the plug on the partnership.
Germany is facing the prospect of months of political uncertainty with the collapse of the coalition, which has been fragile since its inception after the 2017 election, a growing likelihood. It also raises the prospect that Merkel, who has said she will not run for another term in office, will face an earlier exit from the political stage than she intended.
Walter-Borjans and Esken narrowly secured first place in the SPD leadership vote on Saturday on 53%, beating the expected winners Olaf Scholz, the finance minister and vice-chancellor, and Klara Geywitz by eight points in a second-round runoff.
The result, delivered on a 54% turnout of the 425,000 SPD members, was a blow to Scholz, one of the architects of the grand coalition, and is widely seen as a vote of no confidence in him.

She joined the SPD at the age of 29, and has been in the Bundestag since 2013, taking a clear left-wing position, and like Walter-Borjans also critical of the SPD´s ""neoliberal"" politics under Gerhard Schröder, and voting against a tightening of the government's extradition policy, but has largely remained low-profile.
Married with three children, she counts among her hobbies woodland walks with her dog, as well as music and literature.
During the campaign as well as criticising the grand coalition, she made a particular point of stressing the need for reform of the European Union including introducing a Union-wide fiscal policy including cracking down on tax evasion.
The immediate focus is now on Scholz. If he decides he has to resign from his ministerial roles as a result of the defeat, the coalition would in effect be over, even if an election would not happen until well into next year.
The uncertainty reflects the tensions at the heart of German politics, following ever stronger challenges to the mainstream parties from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland, the leftwing Die Linke and the Greens.
The central plank of the leadership campaign by Walter-Borjans and Esken was their opposition to the SPD’s participation in the coalition, which is in part blamed for its decreasing support. Many in the party believe that governing in Merkel’s shadow has contributed to its poor showings in regional and European elections this year, which in turn led to the resignation of Andrea Nahles, the SPD’s first female leader.
It is the first time the party will have two people at the helm, with the new leaders, who are due to be sworn in at the SPD’s headquarters next Friday, saying they will only consider continuing to support the government if major concessions are made by the CDU.
Among their main demands are an increase in the minimum wage from €9 an hour to €12 and a backtrack on the government’s central fiscal policy of balancing the federal budget, known as the “schwarze Null” or the “black zero”, to allow for more spending on infrastructure and welfare programmes. They are also calling for a more radical approach on the climate emergency.
The CDU has made it clear it is unlikely to accept such demands. Speaking after the result, Paul Ziemiak, the party’s general secretary, said: “Our aim is to govern Germany well, and the foundations for this are in our coalition agreement. This internal decision by the SPD changes nothing in this regard.”
If the coalition dissolves, Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, would have to choose whether to resign, call a confidence vote, or attempt to lead a minority government under her leadership or that of someone else within the CDU, or to start negotiations over the formation of a new government.
The CDU is itself in a precarious position. Even if it obtained the strongest result in a general election, which is considered likely, recent poll results indicate its vote share could well be lower than in 2017, when it secured just under 33%, its worst result in almost 70 years. The resulting CDU-SPD alliance took six months to negotiate.
Addressing the party, Eskens said she recognised the need to bring the party together. “If we want to succeed we need everyone,” she said. “Not only those who voted for us. We extend our hands to everyone. Now is the time to stand together.”
Asked whether he believed the coalition was on the verge of collapse, Walter-Borjans said: “Ah, not yet, let’s wait and see.”"

Some of its top players nominate the person they most admire
‘Raised in an era of repression, stagnation and surveillance in East Germany, she has not wasted one breath of free air’
Tim Cook has been the CEO of Apple since 2011. Here, he nominates German chancellor Angela Merkel.
These are challenging times, and naysayers may tell you to measure this decade by its darkest moments. Angela Merkel, with her quiet strength, dignity and abiding faith in the free world, shows us every day why we should choose optimism instead. Raised in an era of repression, stagnation and surveillance in East Germany, she has not wasted one breath of free air. She has spent her career in public life keeping alive the idea that we are bigger than our differences, that shared belief in powerful values can bind us closer than skin colour, or language, or national history.
She has been an unshakable cornerstone of the European project. She has been a visionary advocate for carrying forward the fundamental right to privacy into the digital age. She has been a steady economic hand during years of crisis and rising uncertainty. And she has shown steadfast commitment to the values of freedom, inclusivity and the rule of law amid Europe’s migration crisis. Through every twist and turn, through every seemingly intractable challenge, she has come out looking wiser, more prudent and more durable than those who have doubted her.
Not merely a trailblazer as Germany’s first female leader, she has become a great standard-bearer for what leadership ought to look like. In many instances, she could have made a much easier path for herself by banging on the podium and finding scapegoats, in trading long-term prosperity for short-term advantage. But she knows what lurks at the end of that road, and she has never been willing to take even a single step down it.
I was fortunate to meet her for the first time in 2015, and every time we’ve met since then she has been quick to flash that small, knowing smile, eyes crinkling with the conviction and confidence of a leader who has seen worse – and who knows, even when surrounded by doubters, that we are headed somewhere better. I admire her greatly, and I wish we had more like her.
‘She is a journalist who has chosen to risk her life to do her job and we are all better off as a result’
Amal Clooney is a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers in London, specialising in international law and human rights. Here, she nominates journalist Maria Ressa, who in 2012 cofounded Rappler, one of the first multimedia news websites in the Philippines.
Maria Ressa is 5ft 2in, but she stands taller than most in her pursuit of the truth. Like any journalist in the Philippines, she has two choices: toe the government line and be safe; or risk her life to do her job. She has chosen the latter, and we are all better off as a result.
Maria is a Filipino-American woman who became CNN’s bureau chief in south-east Asia. Seven years ago, she teamed up with three female colleagues to set up the online news website Rappler. And very quickly it made waves.
Rappler is now one of the most influential sites in the Philippines, and, like any responsible journalist, Maria has been critical of the government’s record. Rappler has published reports on corruption by President Duterte’s administration, his weaponisation of social media to silence critics, and his support for death squads that have reportedly murdered more than 27,000 Filipinos in the name of a war on drugs. The authorities have responded with the full weight of the state. Duterte has vilified Maria’s reporting as “fake news”. He has helped amplify online attacks against her, and Rappler at one point had its operating licence revoked.
Duterte’s administration is now pursuing Maria through a series of prosecutions that seek to criminalise alleged sales of her company’s stocks to a foreign entity, and directly target her reporting with charges of criminal libel. She now faces a sentence of up to 63 years behind bars. According to Maria’s local lawyers, this is the first time in recent history that such laws have been used to target a journalist in one of Asia’s oldest democracies. But it is a sign of things to come.
This is why, Maria has told me, she has to defend herself against the charges. When I first met her, she was out on bail – as she is today – speaking at a conference in New York. When she asked me to act as her lawyer, I asked whether there was any judge in the Philippines who could be fair and independent enough to acquit her. She was not sure. I asked whether anyone other than Duterte would have the power to pardon her? They did not. Despite these odds, she went home. And I took the case. Because, as Maria explained, she is “holding up the ceiling” for anyone else who dares to speak.
Doing so is already dangerous. The UN has found that there has been a “deterioration of the human rights situation” under Duterte, including through the repeated targeting of journalists. The president has called journalists “spies” and warned that they are “not exempted from assassination”. If Maria, a US citizen, can now be locked up for doing her work, the message to other journalists and independent voices is clear: be quiet, or you’ll be next.
Maria’s struggle is one that defines our times. Data gathered in the last few years shows more journalists being imprisoned and killed than at any time since records began, threatening the very foundations of democracy and a free society. Authoritarian leaders have every advantage over those they try to intimidate, yet people like Maria are fighting back.
Maria is speaking truth to power. She is holding up the ceiling for others. If it comes crashing down, I will do all I can to get her out.
‘People told me Occupy was a bad idea. Vitalik’s cryptocurrency will defy people in the same way’
Micah White founded the economic protest movement Occupy Wall Street in 2011. He published The End Of Protest: A New Playbook For Revolution in 2016. Here, he nominates programmer Vitalik Buterin, who cofounded the cryptocurrency Ethereum.
In activism, it’s hard to break out of the consensus – to propose a new idea, and not let being shut down stop you. Vitalik Buterin has done just that. He’s only 25. He invented Ethereum when he was 19 and studying Bitcoin. He basically wanted to embed a computer inside money, via programs known as smart contracts. The idea was rejected by the Bitcoin community, but he pushed forward, and now Ethereum is one of the decade’s most promising technologies for social change.
Vitalik is interested in how technology can be used for good. The Bitcoin community couldn’t care less about that; they’re just trying to make money. When I met Vitalik, he asked, “Do you think we’re going to be able to tokenise natural resources?” What he meant was: can we take a natural resource and represent it as a cryptocurrency, so that the value of the coin increases if the resources are protected? This is a whole different direction for environmental activism.
Ethereum is a system of smart contracts that are completely binding – they are unchangeable and publicly verifiable. Key aspects of international agreements, such as the Paris agreement to combat climate change, could be more easily enforced if people could tell when promises had been broken. You’d be shifting power away from corruptible international organisations. In that sense, Vitalik is at the forefront of a new wave of globalism.
In the future we’ll see other activists creating new forms of money that embody their economic ideals. I dream of redistributive currencies that automatically share a portion of each transaction with everyone in the economy. A lot of the ideas that have been floating around the left, like the Robin Hood tax on financial transactions, are hard to implement in the real world but easy to implement with a cryptocurrency. Imagine the reaction when governments realise global social movements are using Ethereum in ways that we never predicted.
The most impactful changes come from the places that we least expect. When we came up with Occupy Wall Street, everyone told me it was a bad idea and they weren’t interested. I see a similar reaction with Ethereum: people can’t see its potential, and that is why it will defy them.
‘My abiding memory of the Globes? We picked tarot cards together and she wore the best shoes’
Actor Emma Watson was appointed UN Women goodwill ambassador in 2014 and helped launch HeForShe, a UN campaign for the advancement of gender equality. Here, she nominates Marai Larasi MBE, who was until recently the executive director of black feminist organisation Imkaan and co-chair of the End Violence Against Women coalition. In 2018, she and Watson attended the Golden Globes together as part of the launch of Time’s Up.
Marai Larasi is mother to Ikamara and Jahred, but she is a mother to many. She is the person on the frontline of the issues I care about in the UK – from feminism to LGBTQI+ rights. Throughout this decade, Marai has supported and championed women who have survived unimaginable abuses. She is there for people who have no one and nothing, in their hardest moments.
Who knows what’s going to happen in the next decade? If the apocalypse comes, I’d ride into battle in her wake. This would definitely make her laugh because she is the least violent person I know, in word, gesture and thought, even though she speaks beautifully about rage. She is all sorts of beautiful contradictions.
She is contained, having carefully learned to wield her energy. She knows when to use it and when not to, and knows that “no” is a complete sentence. She is passionately vegan, in the funniest, least self-aggrandising or patronising way possible. She just cocks her head sideways at people as if to say, “What on earth are they doing, eating animals?” She’s a neat freak. Whatever Marie Kondo is on, Marai is on, too. Again, if the apocalypse comes, I’m hiding out in Marai’s room. She is heavy and light, old and young, an anvil that’s fluid.
My abiding memory of attending the Golden Globes with Marai? Two things. We picked tarot cards before we went, and she wore the best shoes I’ve ever seen. I bought her fluffy Birkenstocks as a thank you gift, which her children think are an abomination. I am told she wears them anyway.
I wish I could name the single most impactful thing she has done over the last decade, but I haven’t known her long enough, and she is notoriously modest, rarely speaking about all that she is juggling. Personally, though, it was probably something incredibly simple she said to me the first time we met. We were at Imkaan and she introduced herself as a black lesbian feminist. Why, I asked, did she feel the need to define herself this specifically? She answered and later sent me an Audre Lorde quote explaining that it is our differences that make us more powerful, not weaker. Knowing our experiences are different doesn’t fracture us; it makes us more intimate, stronger, more connected.
I find her presence in the world profoundly comforting. I’ve never met a woman I felt had more of the answers.
‘If you see a self-driving car, or scan a cheque with your bank’s app – that’s all down to Yann’
Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger launched the photo-sharing app Instagram in 2010, before stepping down last year. Here, they nominate Yann LeCun, the chief AI scientist at Facebook.
Kevin Systrom When Mike and I left, we asked, “What’s had the most effect on Instagram over the years?” And we both agreed it was machine learning. Yann LeCun is one of the very few people to move it from being a buzzword to something that really mattered to companies and academics alike. Machine learning revolutionised Instagram, from suggesting friends to follow, to watching out for objectionable content.
Image recognition wouldn’t be possible without Yann’s work. It has transformed all sorts of industries. Being able to look at satellite data and understand global warming, or content on Instagram that needs to be followed up by law enforcement – the things that keep people safe or transform the world in a meaningful way wouldn’t be possible without him.
Mike Krieger Yann has been in the field of AI and machine learning since the late 80s, but it’s only in the last 10 years that the rest of the industry has caught up; his impact is now everywhere. If you’re on the street and you see a self-driving car, or you’re on Instagram and you feel safe because something has been removed, or if you do something as trivial as scanning a cheque using your bank’s app, that’s all down to Yann.
The whole area of how AI can keep us safe online will continue to be important as the amount of content posted on all of these networks grows. In the next 10 years, Yann will be able to take machine learning from something that was typically done on very large computers to something that runs on people’s phones. It can help you take better photos because it knows what’s in the image; it can help you solve all kinds of problems.
‘I’m a sexual assault survivor and Tarana’s work has given me a sense of community’
Jameela Jamil is an actor and activist behind the 2018 movement I Weigh. Here, she nominates civil rights activist Tarana Burke, who founded the original Me Too campaign in 2006.
Tarana Burke is a woman who has used her own sexual assault as a tool to help and empower other survivors. She has dedicated her life to it. I don’t think enough people recognise how extraordinary she is. A lot of very famous women were credited [for #MeToo and Time’s Up] and, while I’m not undermining them, I do think the way in which we celebrated the movement could have included Tarana more. I didn’t come across her work until a couple of years ago, because of her lack of privilege, and it’s such vital work for our generation and the generations after.
There has been tremendous, palpable progress with #MeToo and Time’s Up, and the topic is now mainstream. People who perhaps weren’t well versed in the nuance of consent are now looking back on their own sexual history and wondering what they could have done to be more sensitive. It has changed sex. That’s enormous in terms of an impact.
I’m a sexual assault survivor, and Tarana’s work has meant the world to me because I feel a sense of community. She has afforded us a dignity and the right to speak out. There was a moment where women started to push back against men who claimed they were victims of sexual assault, too, and Tarana was one of the first people to step out and say #MeToo is for everyone. This isn’t just a women’s movement: this is for all survivors.
A lot of people have stopped talking about #MeToo; we see less of the Time’s Up logo, and conversations have moved on. But she hasn’t. She goes to schools and talks to children. She is invested in the next generation, and I think that’s truly the path to change.
‘Jane and I had skin cancer at the same time. I admired how she did press with a bandage on’
Caitlyn Jenner is a former Olympic gold medalist who came out as a trans woman in 2015. She published her memoir, The Secrets Of My Life, in 2017 and founded the Caitlyn Jenner Foundation to promote equality and combat discrimination. Here, she nominates Jane Fonda, whom she first met at Studio 54 in the 70s.
I want to applaud Jane Fonda’s work as a female activist. She is setting a great example, at 81, that age shouldn’t stop you standing up for what you believe in. Her activism on Capitol Hill, to fight climate change, is making the world a better place for younger generations, and setting an example for them, as well. I admire her commitment to a cause that is so important for our future.
Jane and I went through a skin cancer scare at the same time. Hers was on her lip and mine was on my nose. Growing up in the 50s and 60s, sunscreen wasn’t a big thing. My parents weren’t lathering me up with SPF before I played outside. I admire how Jane had no qualms about doing press with a bandage on her face and speaking out about what she was going through.
In 2005, [alongside Gloria Steinem and Robin Morgan] Jane founded the Women’s Media Center, a nonprofit organisation whose goal is to ensure women are represented in the media. Diversity in film and TV is an important cause to me, and I have been working on trans representation these past few years.
It’s notable that Jane’s activism began long before this decade. She started speaking out on politics in the 1970s, and hasn’t stopped being vocal about race equality, women’s rights and the environment, whatever the consequences. The world is a better place with her in it.
‘We met as babies on Tumblr. Her early work – using ballpoint, charcoal – speaks loud and clear’
Solange Knowles is a Grammy-award winning musician and visual artist. Here, she nominates the artist Toyin Ojih Odutola.
Toyin Ojih Odutola is one of the most profound and masterfully skilled visual storytellers of my generation. Her drawings take the lives of the noble, the proud, the gentle and grounded, and make them all exceptional characters who speak to you from out of the frame. She dismantles the myths of “representation” and exhibits them in a language which is truly her own.
We first met in 2011 as little babies on Tumblr. When I saw her images for the first time I was stunned and moved, and emailed her to tell her. We’ve been friends ever since. Each year I learn more and more from her – she is boundless. I remember seeing All These Garlands Prove Nothing VIII at the Jack Shainman Gallery in New York in 2013, and the eyes followed me around everywhere I went. There were so many confrontations and complexities about identity that spoke to me and pierced me.
Toyin is passionate and honest, and the most intelligent woman I know. She does not apologise for any of it. She dedicates herself to her work like no one else I’ve seen, and both takes up and protects the space she deserves. When I’m on the straw I think is my last, she always says something to remind me of my power. But within all of it, there is a beautiful, nurturing kindness that is so genuine and true. I strive to be more like her every day.
Prior to creating my film When I Get Home, Toyin and I would often speak about the limitlessness of blackness as a dimension, a space and universe. I was very comfortable with the palette I had been using, and comforted by the light and lightness in my work, but it couldn’t have been further from where life was taking me. Toyin helped me reimagine and lean into the vastness and endlessness of blackness, and embrace that in film making.
I remember her saying, “How do I make that whiteness ‘other’, so that it’s no longer a black mark on a white ground but the other way around?” Even in Toyin’s early works, the materials she used – black ballpoint, graphite and charcoal – all speak very loud and clear to this. I thank her for ushering in new considerations of all the endless possibilities and ways to emphasise blackness.
‘Time with Mary, though rare, leaves me dancing down the street. She writes as if her hair is on fire’
Lena Dunham is an actor, writer and film-maker, and creator of HBO’s Girls. Here, she nominates Mary Karr, who published The Art Of Memoir in 2015, and teaches at Syracuse University in New York.
When you hear the word changemaker, there are some obvious visuals: a politician visiting a foreign climate in a hazmat suit. The inventor of a cancer drug doing something with beakers. Someone testifying before Congress, loudly yelling, “I object, sir!” then emerging triumphant on to grey stone steps. But what of the quiet, private change that happens in mundane places, in church basements and on street corners with a cup of coffee, and sitting in sticky pleather chairs in a doctor’s waiting room, a comforting hand on a shaking back? What about the people who quietly rescue others every day and, in a beautiful twist, tell no one?
Mary Karr is a writer, memoirist and poet whose book The Liar’s Club burst on to the scene in 1995, sitting on the New York Times bestsellers list for over a year. In it, Karr details her appallingly rough childhood with the steel-trap sense of humour that has come to define her work. Since then she’s explored issues of addiction, religion and self-actualisation in Cherry, Lit and The Art of Memoir.
I first met Mary six years ago, standing nervously to the side at a Christmas party, and found her affection so positively overwhelming that I teared up in the taxi home. I was pleased to find that the woman who had written such lines as, “For me, everything’s too much and nothing’s enough” was as pithy and powerful as her pages.
Our friendship was a casually intense one – time together, though rare, left me dancing down the street – until one day in early 2018 when, racked with fear and hooked on medication I’d been told would make me well, I called her. I knew she was an alcoholic in recovery. I knew she helped others suffering from addiction. But I didn’t have a plan for the call, just what was left of my voice, timid and quaking. Good thing she did have a plan, one she’s executed countless times, and she single-handedly dragged me back to the world of the living by telling me there were places that addicts gathered and that those places would welcome me.
She celebrated my milestones, even the tiniest ones, with candy and sushi and socks. She sat by my side in the hospital when early sobriety delivered a blow in the form of a health emergency. Somehow, she was there for me while also doing the same for others, and never forgetting to grade assignments or work on her own book.
Before I knew Mary, her writing reminded me that memoir, especially memoir by women, has a purpose and a place. It’s necessary to tell our stories and to listen to others’. Mary writes, as she’d say, like her hair is on fire: with an urgency, the need to expel and express. And she gives us permission to follow suit. She is also deeply engaged in making sure that addiction doesn’t swallow any more into its giant whale’s mouth. She does none of this for the glory of it all, because really there is none.
“My head thinks it can kill me… and go on living without me,” she writes in Lit, perfectly summing up the broken thinking of a drunk on the loose. But I cannot live without her, as a writer or as an addict. And I am one of so many – readers, students, people who bumped into her in the back room of a church – who have been changed by her steady love.
‘I want my son to have a future. Greta inspires me’
Tom Daley is a British diver who won two gold medals for England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games and took home bronze medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. Here, he nominates Greta Thunberg.
There has been a lot of change in the past 10 years – marriage equality being a big one for me [Daley married Dustin Lance Black in 2017]. But the issue on everyone’s lips is climate change. We’ve all had a big wake-up call, thanks to Greta Thunberg.
She is the reason we are all talking about our planet. She is the reason people are protesting all over the world. She has reached so many people, and that’s how real change can be brought about.
Greta’s speech at the UN’s Climate Action Summit blew me away – seeing a young person holding older people accountable for what they are and are not doing. I want my son to have a planet he can live on, and his children, too. There are easy lifestyle changes we can all make. I’ve reduced the amount of meat and dairy I eat; I recycle everything I can and I don’t waste things. Wherever possible I use public transport, too.
Greta has inspired me, and a new generation.

The embattled leader of Germany’s ruling Christian Democrats has challenged delegates at the party’s conference to back her vision or else “end it here and now”, amid deep divisions over the future direction of the party.
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told the CDU’s annual conference in Leipzig she was putting her future on the line in response to stinging criticism over her leadership style.
The 57-year-old, who took over as CDU head from Angela Merkel almost a year ago, shocked party members towards the end of a rousing 90-minute speech by inviting them to move to vote her out if they wanted to.
“If you want, let’s get this out into the open today. Let’s lay it to rest, here, now and today,” she said. “But if you’re of the opinion that we should embark on this road together, let’s roll up our sleeves and get on with it.”
Most of the 1,000 participants gave her a standing ovation, applauding for seven minutes.
Saxony’s state leader, Michael Kretschmer, who is hosting the congress, told delegates the applause was a signal that Kramp-Karrenbauer had the backing of the party. “Today is not the end, Annegret,” he said. “Today is when we really get going.”
The 74-year-old party is reeling from recent poll disasters, and low public approval ratings for Kramp-Karrenbauer. It has lost millions of voters to the rightwing populist Alternative für Deutschland as well as to the Greens. Its share of the vote in polls for the Bundestag, which is currently home to seven parties, is hovering at around 30% – a paltry figure compared to the results it was used to.
It is also struggling to agree on the direction it should take once Merkel’s term as German chancellor ends. Merkel announced last year that she was stepping down as CDU leader after 18 years and would not stand as chancellor again after her fourth and current term, which is due to end in 2021.
Kramp-Karrenbauer admitted the party had had a “difficult year” following historically poor showings in state polls in Saxony, Brandenburg and Thuringia as well as in the European Union parliamentary elections. But in a dig at her arch-rival, Friedrich Merz, who called Merkel’s government “abysmal” and has led the calls for the party to shift from the centre to the right, she said the tendency within the party to criticise its own members in the government was self-defeatist and “not a good campaigning strategy”.
Addressing delegates after Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merz did not, as had been widely expected, continue his criticism of the government. He instead thanked Kramp-Karrenbauer for a “combative, courageous and forward-looking speech” and said the years of CDU-led governments had been “good years for Germany”. He said he was happy to take part in reshaping the CDU “if you want me”.
But Merz supporters speaking on the conference sidelines said if Merkel’s grand coalition broke up, Merz would be waiting in the wings. One of his staunchest backers, Christian von Stetten, said before the conference that “the party’s future direction will not just be left to Kramp-Karrenbauer”.
Kramp-Karrenbauer has been seen as Merkel’s successor, sometimes even referred to as “mini Merkel” since she was narrowly elected party leader last December. She was subsequently appointed as defence minister and has drawn both praise and criticism for pushing for Germany to play a stronger role on the international stage.
Among the issues due to be discussed at the two-day conference are digitalisation, including whether the Chinese firm Huawei should participate in the future of its 5G network, a proposal to ban headscarfs for young girls, the introduction of a basic pension and whether the German flag should be flown outside schools.
While Merkel’s presence will continue to loom large in the party as long as she remains chancellor, her role at the conference is low-key for the first time since 2000. In an opening speech she defended the work of her coalition government but reiterated that she would not interfere in the question of where the party chose to go."
"26";"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/22/time-to-go-angela-merkel-germanys-sake-europes";2019-11-22;"Angela Merkel must go – for Germany’s sake, and for Europe’s";"Hers is a government for undemanding times, with none of the ambition needed to face the giant challenges of today
If Germany is the heart of Europe, then it is currently the slow-beating heart of a well-fed businessman resting on his office couch after an ample lunch. For Europe’s sake, and for Germany’s own, that heart needs to beat a little faster.
It’s not that German elites don’t intellectually recognise the problems gathering all around them. Berlin, which is beginning to rival London as a thinktank hub, is pullulating with clever people who can tell you exactly why, faced with the challenges of Brexit, populism, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, climate change and AI – to name but a few – Europe needs more strategic autonomy, digital innovation and sustainable growth. What is missing is a sense of urgency and the ability to translate these abstract goals into dynamic policies that German voters will actually support. For now, Germany is effectively willing the ends but not the means.
Why this stasis? Because Germany has been doing quite nicely, thank you. It has not felt the pain that, one way or another, most other parts of the continent have experienced. Crisis, what crisis? Obviously, this is not true of everyone, but even those East Germans who have recently voted in shockingly large numbers for the far-right, xenophobic Alternative für Deutschland are not primarily complaining about their economic circumstances.
Beneath the surface of the country’s success story, there is a growing drumbeat of anxiety. Has it wasted the fat years?
Most Germans probably still view the long period of Angela Merkel’s chancellorship – a staggering 14 years on Friday – as a stable and good time for the country. The German economy has done well over this period. This is partly because it can draw on all the familiar German business strengths, and partly because the Merkel chancellorship has benefited from reforms of the labour market and welfare system introduced under the Social Democratic chancellor Gerhard Schröder. But it has also profited very significantly from external circumstances.
The post-1989 opening-up of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and their subsequent accession to the European single market gave a wonderful opportunity for German manufacturers to relocate production facilities just next door, using cheap skilled labour in a kind of Mitteleuropa 2.0. Not least, the euro has kept the German currency at a lower external exchange rate than it would otherwise have soared to (witness what happened to the Swiss franc). So the German export machine has powered ahead, generating eye-popping trade surpluses. And because the country has an evangelical protestant commitment to running a balanced budget – the totemic “black zero” – and a constitutionally anchored “debt brake”, it has healthy public finances that most democratic capitalist countries would die for.
Yet beneath the surface of this success story there is a growing drumbeat of anxiety. Maybe the country has wasted the fat years, not investing enough in its ageing infrastructure? Maybe it is missing out on the digital revolution, so its fabled car industry now looks distinctly old-fashioned compared with the self-drive electric cars being developed by the giants of Silicon Valley and China. (Tesla’s announcement that it will build a factory near Berlin is both a tribute to Germany and a frontal challenge to national champions such as Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen.) Maybe all that has been achieved over many decades will now be eroded thanks to immigration, Trump’s tariff war, populism and other uncertainties. The anxious leitmotif of popular sentiment, especially in the predominant western part of the country, is “let’s hang on to what we’ve got”.
So 30 years on from a peaceful revolution that opened the door to German unification, we have a defensive, conservative society underpinning a defensive, status quo power. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, impatiently wants to revolutionise Europe, giving the old continent Napoleonic strategic ambition, but Merkel’s Germany is not playing ball. As one adviser to Macron memorably put it to me: “Aristocrats don’t vote for revolution.” (If the Germans are the pre-1789 aristocrats in this analogy, does that make the French the sans-culottes?) German responses to Macron’s European initiatives have ranged from the lukewarm to the dismissive.
The politics match the economics and society. Germany is the only country I know where politicians actively strive to sound boring. This is part of a culture of responsibility, sobriety and moderation that embodies a conscious rejection of the wildness of German political behaviour between 1914 and 1945. The speeches can rapidly send one to sleep, but if the alternative is Boris Johnson and Donald Trump, I’ll settle for serious and boring.
For 10 of the last 14 years, Merkel has presided over grand coalition governments, bringing together the centre-right Christian Democrats and the centre-left Social Democrats. This has given continuous stable government, but at a cost. Consensual centrism has not encouraged the robust political debate essential to a liberal democracy. Conservative Germans have long complained that “we have two social democratic parties”. This is a perfectly competent government for undemanding times, but with none of the ambition needed to face the giant challenges of today. Meanwhile, having both main parties in power together for so long has strengthened support for the extremes, on both left and right.
Everyone knows that this is the twilight of the Merkel era, but the Merkeldämmerung is taking longer than the most epic Bayreuth production of Wagner’s Götterdämmerung (Twilight of the Gods). Yet in a recent Politbarometer poll, more than two thirds of those asked said they want Merkel and her government to continue until the end of the current electoral term, in autumn 2021. Of course, it’s entirely up to the German people to decide who they want to govern them, but I would respectfully suggest that this is not in the best interest of either Germany or Europe.
Merkel and her Social Democrat vice chancellor, Olaf Scholz, have a cunning plan to outlive even Wagner’s gods. First they have marked their own homework, producing a half-term report on the grand coalition government that suggests it has done, on the whole, quite brilliantly. Second, they had a nice little row about pensions that ended – surprise! – with a constructive compromise. Now they aim to get support for continuity at their respective party conferences: the Christian Democrats at the end of this month, the Social Democrats early next month.
Fortunately, even German politics are not that predictable. Merkel and her putative successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, will face criticism from a rightwing challenger, Friedrich Merz. Scholz has to compete for the party leadership with a pair of contenders from the left. If, under Teuto-Corbynista leadership, the Social Democrats actually decided to leave the grand coalition, then a variety of possibilities would arise. Perhaps a Christian Democrat minority government? Or a “Jamaica” coalition of Christian Democrats (black), Free Democrats (yellow) and Greens (green). Or new elections, possibly leading to a black-green government.
Whatever happens, one thing seems to me clear: in Germany’s own long-term interest, and in Europe’s, it’s time for a change.

Postwar German politics has a reputation for being moderate, consensual and a touch on the dull side. But there have been moments of high drama. In November 1959, for example, the Social Democratic party (SPD) abandoned its historic ambition to replace capitalism with socialism, dropped the Marxist account of class struggle and began to pitch itself as a broad-based Volkspartei (people’s party). History vindicated the decision. For the next 50 years or so, the SPD vied for power with the country’s other great political force, the CDU (and its CSU Bavarian ally), as both parties regularly achieved a vote share of over 40%.
Famed for their practice of big-tent politics, what the CDU and SPD would give for such numbers now. The agonies of Brexit and the rise of rightwing populism have claimed the political limelight around Europe. But those looking for clues to the continent’s future would do well to watch Germany closely over the coming weeks.
The traditional powerhouses, which formed a “grand coalition” in 2018 to run the country, are each divided and dispirited. A succession of rebuffs in regional elections has led to calls in both parties for more radical and distinct policies. Later this month, in an innovation born of desperation, SPD members will vote in a new leader. They will choose between two joint candidacies, one from the left and one from the right of the movement. To say that there is pressure to get this right would be an understatement. Last month, in state elections in Thuringia, the westernmost of the five former East German regions, the party scored a dire 8.2%, and finished a humiliating fourth. The state was won by the hard-left Die Linke, which has always polled well in the region and on this occasion received almost four times as many votes, its most emphatic win yet. This defeat for the Social Democrats followed a similarly poor result in Saxony, and nationally the SPD is polling at a miserable 15%.
Results like that in Thuringia point both to Germany’s political fragmentation and to a more general challenge to the country’s economic orthodoxies. The new head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has suggested that Germany should spend more and save less to boost the eurozone economy. One of the four candidates for the SPD leadership, Olaf Scholz, is minister for finance in the coalition government and has reiterated his commitment to the so-called schwarze null (black zero) policy, which commits the country to balanced budgets. But the two leftwing candidates, Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, have called for massive investment and an end to the borrowing-averse economics that German politicians have practised since the war. If they are victorious, they are likely to pull the SPD out of the grand coalition and force a snap election.
Meanwhile, the CDU is conducting its own inquest, having been beaten in Thuringia by the far right nationalists of Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Angela Merkel has already said she will not contest the next federal election, due in 2021. But as the party prepares for its annual congress, which begins in Leipzig on Friday, there is talk of an attempt to block her presumed replacement, the unpopular CDU chair, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. Some figures in the party are advocating an end to the ban on pacts with AfD, a terrible move that would significantly shift the centre of gravity on the right of German politics, and represent a definitive break with the liberal immigration policies of Merkel.
As has happened elsewhere, the challenges of 21st-century capitalism in western European societies – low growth, the legacy of deindustrialisation, migration and the fallout from the crash – have eventually led to a crisis of the political centre. But Germany’s economic pre-eminence means that its response carries a special weight within Europe. Last week, it narrowly avoided going into recession. Its economy remains strong but the boom has ended and German politics will have to respond with more expansionary strategies. Stability has long been the dogma in Berlin, but 60 years after the legacy of Marx and Engels was discreetly put to one side by the SPD, revisionism is in the air again."

Thirty years ago, Elfriede Begrich delivered a stirring sermon to a packed Gethsemane church in East Berlin. She quoted Deuteronomy 2.7: “God watches over you as you wander through this great wilderness”. “In those days every verse in the Bible sounded like a political manifesto,” the former Protestant pastor recalled this Saturday.
Her congregation got the message. On 4 November 1989 they flooded onto the streets by the thousands bearing lit candles to protest against a repressive East German regime that days later would yield power to people and raise the toll bars at the border crossings in the city. As the reunified German capital commemorated the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, revellers were able to hear Begrich’s words again.
A filmed re-enactment of the pivotal protest in Alexanderplatz, curated by her son Aljoscha and directed by the Argentinian artist Lola Arias, played on a loop inside the nearby ruins of the former East German statistics office, one of 200 commemorative events playing out at seven locations across the city. Begrich was the only performer who had chosen to play herself.
Flooded with the memories of the dramatic last few days of the socialist republic, she recalled the “immense feeling of freedom” on the streets that day. But reliving the emotion was no longer easy. “30 years on, remembering those days is a much more contemplative process than even on the 20th anniversary,” she said. “The memory of my emotions is tainted with a certain darkness.
“I had taken to the streets for a third way, not the old socialism we had in the GDR, but neither the rapacious Manchester capitalism of the west. I wanted socialism with a human face … But the peaceful revolution soon slipped from the grasp of those who really wanted it. It became the revolution of those who wanted to buy colour TVs and bananas.”
The 72-year-old was not the only Berliner in a reflective mood on Saturday. Previous Berlin Wall anniversaries have been triumphant events. 10 years ago, the city organised two kilometres of gigantic styrofoam slabs to be lined up between the Brandenburg Gate and Potsdamer Platz, which were then toppled like dominoes.
For the 25th anniversary in 2014, the artist brothers Christopher and Marc Bauder created a lichtgrenze or “border of light”, made up of 8,000 balloons along a 15km portion of the strip that once separated east and west. Thousands oo-ed and ah-ed as the symbolic border vanished into the night sky.
This year, however, there was no single unifying event that brought Berliners together, and few of the artworks and events across the city dealt specifically with the border construction and its disappearance.
Second world war ends and the Red Army captures Berlin. The city is divided in half; the Soviet Union in the east, and the British, Americans and French in the west.
The Soviets begin the Berlin blockade. The following day the United States begins the Berlin air lift delivering food and fuel supplies to the city.
The Federal Republic of Germany, West Germany, is founded. Twelve days later the German Democratic Republic, East Germany, is founded.
Berlin airlift ends.
The Red Army steps in to suppress riots by East Berlin workers over work conditions.
The border between East and West Berlin is closed. Soldiers start to build the wall, at first with barbed wire and light fencing which in the coming years develops into a heavily complex series of wall, fortified fences, gun positions and watchtowers that are heavily guarded. The wall ended up being 96 miles long and the average height of the concrete divide was 11.8ft.
The wall claims its first life as a man falls trying to climb down from his top-floor flat in Bernauerstrasse in East Berlin, to reach the pavements of West Germany.
US President John F Kennedy visits the wall vowing to protect East Berlin, famously declaring ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" (I am a Berliner).

At the wall memorial on Bernauer Straße, chancellor Angela Merkel laid down a red rose, appealing to European leaders and visiting guests to “stand up for democracy and freedom, for human rights and tolerance”. Such values “must always be lived out and defended anew”, she said.
Above the Straße des 17 Juni, the central east-west boulevard named after the 1953 uprising in the GDR, a giant wave made up of 30,000 messages from Germans on little pieces of cloth fluttered in the wind. The work, by the US artist Patrick Shearn was entitled Freedom Cloud, but the emotional impact of walking underneath it was far from euphoric.
By the Oberbaumbrücke Oberbaum bridge in Friedrichshain, a chain of neon buoys and swimming beacons bobbed silently in the waters of the Spree to mark the old liquid border, its lights constantly moving but never disappearing.
At Alexanderplatz, footage of the 1989 demonstrations, which had flared up in protest against evident electoral fraud at communal elections in May that year, was projected onto the grey facade of shopping malls. On Breitscheidplatz and Kurfürstendamm boulevard, light shows and performances recreated the western perspective of the last days of the iron curtain.
Berlin’s senate had spent around €10m (£8.6m) on these decentralised “storytelling locations”, apparently fully resigned to the fact that in 2019 there was not one way to tell the story of the end of the cold war and the collapse of Soviet socialism that everyone could sign up to.
According to a survey by the polling institute Forsa, published by the Berliner Zeitung newspaper this week, 87% of the city’s inhabitants are happy that it is no longer divided, but 42% felt the process of reunification had taken place too quickly. Many, like Elfriede Begrich, had hoped for at least symbolic gestures to assure them that the new Germany would be a fusion of its two halves, rather than a takeover by the west: a new anthem, perhaps, or a new flag.
For her son Aljoscha Begrich, who works for Berlin’s Gorki theatre, positive memories prevailed on Saturday. “The overriding memory I have is of this rapid expansion of my personal horizon. On the maps of Berlin we had at school, the western half of the city was always greyed out. My teacher once said ‘West Berlin doesn’t exist’, and until I went over on the 10th, I had sort of believed him.”
He still felt, however, that the kind of triumphant show with which the city marked previous anniversaries no longer worked in 2019. What he wanted to show with his re-enactment, entitled Audition for a Demonstration, is that the truth about 1989 is complex. “There are contradictory biographies, like the one of my mother, whose church sheltered punks and environmentalists pursued by the state, but who now votes for the Left party, the successor party of the Socialist Unity party she was protesting against then. It wasn’t just one, two, three and then the Brandenburg Gate is open.”
A second video installation in the same building speaks directly of another reason why celebrations of this year’s anniversary feel so muted. Henrike Naumann’s Day X splices together footage of the peaceful revolution with fictionalised eyewitness accounts until it is no longer clear whether the observer is watching a documentary about events in 1989 or rightwing coup in 2019.
At state elections in the east German states this year, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland has surged to second place, often by capitalising on resentment about the handling of reunification and reclaiming the language of the ‘89 protest movement. The slogan of one of the AfD’s campaign posters read Vollende die Wende: “Complete the peaceful revolution.”
In German history, 9 November is a date burdened with meaning for several reasons. It is not just the anniversary of the end of a 40-year separation, but also of the Night of Broken Glass, the pogrom against Jewish citizens carried out by Nazi paramilitaries in 1938.
Before Elfriede Begrich headed into Berlin centre to see her son’s work, she had taken part in a church service to commemorate the latter event.
“I can see why the 30th anniversary matters, but maybe we’ve all had enough of the wall now for a bit.”

Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union risks “tearing itself apart” over her legacy in the wake of a string of poor election results, as some conservative politicians double down on her pro-immigration stance while others eye a pact with the nationalist far-right.
In the eastern state of Thuringia, where the CDU was beaten into third place by the openly xenophobic Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) at state elections last month, 17 politicians from the party have written a letter calling for lifting the cordon sanitaire around the far-right outfit.
The letter, which does not mention the AfD by name, demands a readiness for coalition talks with “all democratically elected parties” – a breach of the CDU’s official party line.
The proposal has been met with vocal condemnation within the CDU’s national leadership. In an op-ed for Der Spiegel published on Wednesday morning, party secretary Paul Ziemiak called the Thuringian leader of the AfD, Björn Höcke, “a Nazi”, arguing that a governing alliance would amount to “a betrayal of our Christian Democratic values”.
If the CDU’s Thuringian branch were to cooperate with the AfD, regional politician Werner Henning told Die Welt, it would “tear apart“ the party.
Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said the letter-writers would “help to make the AfD more socially acceptable.” Already once in German history, Schuster warned, civil politicians had acted as “stirrup holders” for a party run by the far-right.
The wrangle over principles and power in the eastern state is part of a wider free-for-all in the party that has governed Germany for 17 out of 24 postwar terms, facilitated by Merkel’s relative absence from the hubbub of domestic politics and her designated successor’s struggle to build a profile.
CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer was once seen as Merkel’s successor-in-waiting but has struggled to make her mark, even after taking over the defence ministry in July, not least because her mentor’s support for her policy initiatives has remained lukewarm at best.
Friedrich Merz, a conservative of the old guard and darling of the all-powerful Springer media empire, used the poor election results to launch an open attack on Merkel, saying the result was a “vote of mistrust” in her coalition government with the centre left.
“We are in a really difficult situation”, said Merz, who came second in the race for the party chair last December. “In my view that has mainly got to do with the chancellor’s inaction and lack of leadership, which has descended on this country like a veil of fog.”
The row has seen some of the chancellor’s old allies reach to stab her in the back, while some of her fiercest critics have changed tack to fall in line with her centrist interpretation of the CDU’s role.
Health minister Jens Spahn used to be a vocal opponent of Merkel’s stance during the refugee crisis, describing her migration policies as recently as last autumn as “the elephant in the room” that was putting off formerly loyal voters.
In an article for the Guardian, however, the openly gay politician appears to pitch his tent closer to Merkel’s camp rather than that of her detractors. While continuing the warn of the dangers of “uncontrolled immigration”, the former hardliner now strains for a positive message. “Germany is ageing rapidly,” Spahn writes. “Our message to the people of Mexico, the Philippines and all other nations is: if you share our values and want to work with us, please feel cordially invited!”
By contrast, some Merkel loyalists have broken out in open protest against a perceived leadership vacuum at the top. Norbert Röttgen, the chairman of the German Parliament’s foreign relations committee and once seen as one of her allies, told the New York Times: “Germany is now a complete void in everything. I can’t see a European policy, the foreign minister is a void, the chancellor knows everything but does nothing.”
At the CDU’s party conference in Leipzig on 22 November, the row threatens to escalate further, with no ceasefire in sight. “The possibility cannot be excluded”, wrote Süddeutsche Zeitung, “that Merkel’s parting from power could also result in the CDU’s parting from the chancellory”."

Anti-immigrant populists beat Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) to second place in an election in the east German state of Thuringia yesterday, building spectacularly on their steady momentum since first entering the Bundestag two years ago.
According to exit polls, the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) took nearly 24% of the vote, beating the centre-right CDU by one percentage point but, as expected, failing to oust incumbent leftwingers Die Linke. The AfD more than doubled its share of the vote. Despite that, it has no chance of entering power yet, as other parties have ruled out joining it in a coalition.
But the party’s national standing is boosted by the result, which was closely watched in Berlin, as is the status of its state leader Björn Höcke, considered Germany’s most controversial politician, who has been accused of stoking hatred with anti-Jewish rhetoric.
The state now faces months of protracted coalition negotiations. AfD’s showing means it will be impossible for Die Linke (30% of the vote), the left-of-centre Social Democrats (8%) and the Green party (5.5%) to repeat their coalition.
A minority government led by Die Linke is the most likely outcome, reflecting the increasing fragmentation of the political landscape across Germany in recent years.
The CDU, which rules at the national level in a coalition with its Bavarian sister party the CSU and the SPD, suffered its worst result in the state, losing more than 11 percentage points to take 22.5% of the vote.
The election campaign was characterised by Nazi slogans and death threats and overshadowed by the deadly attack on a synagogue in the city of Halle earlier this month.
Mike Möhring, the leader of the CDU in Thuringia, received a death threat during the campaign that quoted the Nazi greeting ‘Heil Hitler!’. Neo-Nazis threatened to stab him in the neck or attack one of his election rallies with a bomb if he did not end his campaign.
The CDU’s general secretary, Paul Ziemiak, said: “It is a bitter result for the CDU ... and this is a bitter day for the democratic centre of Germany in Thuringia.”
Bodo Ramelow, Thuringia’s current prime minister who is extremely popular in the state, has directly blamed Höcke for allowing people to identify with extremist parties.
Ramelow told broadcaster NTV he was proud of Thuringians, who had turned out in record numbers for the vote. He said he hoped that the result would encourage parties who had previously vowed never to work together with his Die Linke to recognise the necessity to do so.
“On a parliamentary level there are various themes on which we can all work together for the common good,” he said. But he was troubled by the AfD’s strong result. “It is painful that voters feel that they need to protest against the grand coalition in this way by choosing someone like Höcke ... But we need to deal with this at the same time, and respect the voters’ decision.”
Speaking to jubilant party faithful on Sunday, Höcke hailed the result as “spectacular”. “I am almost speechless. We fought together, we were victorious together, and now it’s the time to celebrate together.”
The former history teacher, who was accused of contributing to the antisemitic sentiment behind the Halle attack, has drawn criticism for calling Berlin’s Holocaust Memorial a “monument of shame” and for demanding more attention be paid in schools’ history teaching towards ordinary Germans’ suffering in the second world war.
Höcke’s far-right stance is viewed critically within the party, with many AfD members accusing him of threatening its unity. But his ability to draw such an increase in support despite the criticism – even in a state that bears the scars of Germany’s Nazi past with Buchenwald concentration camp – is likely to only bolster support for his tactics.
The Greens’ co-leader Annalena Baerbock said she was disappointed at her party’s performance and that she was “devastated” by the huge gains made by the AfD, referring to it as “fascistic”. She said the result reinforced the need to invest more time and energy in civil society in eastern Germany.
The AfD was formed in 2014 as an anti-establishment force opposed to the euro. It quickly evolved to become an anti-immigrant party following the refugee crisis of 2015 when almost one million refugees arrived in Germany. More recently it has concentrated on highlighting the unjust treatment of eastern German citizens in the 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Die Linke, described as radical left, was established in 2007, emerging from the successor party of the former communist governors of eastern Germany."

Emmanuel Macron has suggested he is against a further Brexit extension as the EU sought to sell the new deal but private comments from Germany’s chancellor highlighted the likelihood that one would still be offered.
As a two-day leaders’ summit in Brussels finished on Friday, the French president said it was time for the current phase in the Brexit negotiations to end. MPs will convene on Saturday to vote on the revised withdrawal agreement and political declaration on the future relationship.
Macron told reporters: “I am not trying to read into the future but I do not think we shall grant any further delay. I think it is time to put an end to these negotiations and move on to the future relationship. And put to an end to what is currently ongoing.
“What matters is to stick to the commitment we made and the deadline we set ourselves. It is up to each and every one to make their own decisions. There shall be no delay unless there are major changes.”
The Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar also sought to scotch talk of an extension, pointing out any decision would have to be approved unanimously by all 27 EU leaders: “I don’t think any MP voting tomorrow should make the assumption that there would be unanimity for an extension.”
Despite the comments, which echoed those of the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, on Thursday, the privately stated position of Angela Merkel is seen in Brussels as closer to the reality of the leaders’ thinking.
During a discussion on Thursday, the German chancellor told EU leaders that a Brexit extension would be unavoidable if British MPs vote down the new deal.
She advised her fellow heads of state and government they could not pretend an extension would not be offered to the UK if it was requested, according to a source familiar with the discussions.
Merkel framed Brexit as a historic issue weighing on the EU and said leaders had a responsibility not to push the UK out without a deal if there was a request for further delay.
The intervention by Macron and Juncker, who sought to “rule out” an extension as he arrived at the summit on Thursday, expose the desire among the EU27 to move the Brexit talks on after two arduous years of negotiation.
In his press conference on Friday, Macron went on to say that Johnson had started out with unacceptable proposals but had then “got into the complexity” of the issue.
He said: “He is who he is, but I think he is a real leader with real strategic thoughts and those who do not take him seriously are wrong and will continue to be wrong”.
Merkel’s comments were made on Thursday, shortly before EU leaders announced their unanimous backing for the new deal with Johnson.
She told Johnson not to tell the British public that EU leaders had ruled out an extension. While EU leaders are anxious for the Brexit deal to pass, they do not wish to be drawn into the vortex of British politics.
The new Brexit deal is essentially the old Brexit deal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a link to the full text.
The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.
Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.
The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a “backstop” but with a permanent tinge.
That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.
Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.
Under the deal, the UK and the EU are “underlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”.
The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that “the United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas” in any future trade talks has been ditched.
Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.
No customs duties will be payable on “personal property” being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.
Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.
A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.
The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.
EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.
The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.
This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.
Lisa O'Carroll Brexit correspondent
During a 25-minute meeting with EU leaders, Johnson expressed confidence he could get a majority for his Brexit deal in a rare Saturday sitting of the Commons.
Thanking the EU for the deal, the prime minister made a short, upbeat statement in which he referred to his school days in Brussels. Johnson attended the European school in Uccle, which educates the children of EU officials.
Johnson also touched on the UK’s long relationship with Europe, suggesting Britain had never been truly European but always half in, half out. It was a businesslike meeting that made some think of the unemotional signing of divorce papers.
Once he had left the room, EU leaders discussed how to respond to any rejection of the deal by the Commons. Some EU leaders, such as Luxembourg’s Xavier Bettel and Malta’s Joseph Muscat, voiced frustration at the idea of another extension.
Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, agreed with Merkel. He later told journalists he would consult EU leaders if there was a request for an extension. But he did not organise a detailed discussion on extension.
“We have not been focusing on the question today, if or when,” Merkel said. “It’s a free decision to be taken by the British parliament.”
With the vote in the Commons on a knife edge, EU leaders are also thinking about the future relationship with the UK. Merkel said the EU now had a clearer idea of the kind of future relationship the UK was seeking, in contrast to the picture sketched out by Theresa May.
“At the time [under May] it wasn’t clear what the future relationship should look like, whether there would be a membership in the single market or not,” she said.
Merkel, who has recently described the UK as a “potential competitor”, said it was clear the UK would be a “third country”, ie completely outside the EU’s economic system, “and we will quickly begin negotiating a free-trade agreement with that third country, Great Britain”."

EU leaders and MEPs have given a cautious welcome to the draft Brexit deal struck between the EU and the UK but warned it faced major hurdles in the British and European parliaments and could take time to ratify.
France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, praised the agreement, saying it “allows us to respond to the political and technical concerns that both we and the British share”, but said it was up to the British prime minister to get it through the House of Commons.
He said he was “reasonably confident this can be ratified by a vote of the British parliament”, but added that “based on past experience, we have to be reasonably cautious … History tells us parliaments may not like the agreement.”
A visibly happy Angela Merkel told reporters in Brussels that achieving the deal had been “real hard work.”
The German chancellor called the agreement “a compromise for all sides” but noted that it contains key demands from the EU side, including maintaining the integrity of the common market and preserving the Good Friday Agreement. She called it “an opportunity to have good, close relations with Britain in future as well.”
Asked whether the EU’s apparent refusal to consider a further extension undermines the UK Parliament, Merkel said: “We will address any decision by the British Parliament and didn’t make any decision today for any eventuality.”
The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said the agreement would allow the UK to leave the EU in an “orderly way”. The backstop had been replaced, he added, and its alternative “does what we need it to do: avoids a hard border between north and south, protects the all-Ireland economy, protects the single market and our place in it”.
However, he pointed out the deal still needed to be discussed by EU leaders at the summit and approved by the European parliament, and declined to say what might happen if it were voted down in the Commons on Saturday. “The best thing we can do in Ireland … is not intervene or interfere in UK internal politics,” Varadkar said.
Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, said he hoped MPs would approve the agreement “because it’s not now people are in favour of Brexit or against Brexit, it’s really not the matter, it’s really now if we are going to have a deal or no deal”.
He added: “[The UK] understands that not having a deal is not good for them either. So I hope they are reasonable on Saturday morning in London, and I hope also that they’ll see that it’s in the interests of everyone to say yes.”
The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said he was hopeful the agreement would pass its Commons test on Saturday. “It looks encouraging. Of course we have to take a look at the details, but it seems all the red lines of the British and Europe have been met,” he said.
The Croatian prime minister, Andrej Plenkovic, said he hoped Brexit had been solved “but we remain prudent”, while his Latvian counterpart, Arturs Karinš, said things “look very promising” but “I guess it will be up to the British parliament”.
The incoming European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who is due to take over from Jean-Claude Juncker at the end of November, said it was important Brexit happened “in an orderly way, as that’s decisive for people and for the economy. It’s also decisive for the starting point of the future relations we’ll have with Britain.”
But she said she was cautious about whether Johnson could secure a Commons majority, and one of her new vice-presidents, Frans Timmermans, said he had “stopped trying to predict what the British parliament will think of it”.
MEPs also advised caution. The European parliament president, David Sassoli, said the parliament was ready to “do its duty” and examine and ratify the deal by 31 October, once it had secured the backing of the UK parliament.
But the parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, told a meeting of his parliamentary group that while the draft accord “safeguards the single market, safeguards the values of the EU, and avoids a border on the island of Ireland … the question for the moment is: will the British parliament agree?”
The leader of the centre-right European People’s party grouping, Manfred Weber, said it would, before approving the deal, “closely scrutinise the details. Our principles are clear: no cherrypicking of the internal market, avoiding a hard border and protecting citizens’ rights.”
The German Green party’s EU affairs spokeswoman also advised all member states to look carefully at the single market rules and how they would be applied under the deal. “Northern Ireland cannot become a huge dumping zone and tax haven,” she said.
And Jens Geier, a German Social Democrat, told Politico the European parliament was unlikely to come to any formal decision until the withdrawal agreement had been approved in both the Commons and the House of Lords, possibly pushing final confirmation back to November."

‘I wonder if Kenan Malik is clear that the ‘Don’t mention the war’ episode of Fawlty Towers is intended to make fun of the British obsession with the Second World War that he criticises?” So wrote an irate John Cleese to the Independent in 1992 in response to an early op-ed of mine on British perceptions of racism in Germany. Yes, I was clear that Cleese had been satirising the British obsession – and brilliantly – but my mention of that Fawlty Towers episode was no doubt clumsy enough to draw Cleese’s ire.
I thought about that letter, and that episode of Fawlty Towers, after the infamous Leave.EU tweet last week. “We didn’t win two world wars to be pushed around by Krauts,” it snorted, in response to Angela Merkel’s supposed demand, in a telephone conversation with Boris Johnson, that Northern Ireland must “forever” stay within the EU customs union.
Thirty years ago, that tweet (had Twitter existed) would have seemed unexceptional. Baiting “Krauts” was then a tabloid sport.
Last week, it drew a torrent of criticism and not just from the usual suspects. Even the Brexit party’s Richard Tice was offended. Leave.EU eventually deleted the tweet and apologised (well, sort of).
There is more than a whiff of hypocrisy about some of this criticism. Tice, after all, was co-founder with Arron Banks of Leave.EU and had no problem with the infamous “breaking point” poster unveiled by Brexit party leader Nigel Farage. Nevertheless, the kerfuffle over the tweet shows how British attitudes have changed.
Nazism remains for most people the touchstone of evil, even if, in an age in which every brutal dictator is a “new Hitler” and every politician with reactionary views a “fascist”, the term has become so relativised as to be almost meaningless. The Second World War, however, no longer occupies the place it once did in British consciousness.
When Basil Fawlty was failing not to mention the war, that war provided for Britain a historical moment of triumph with which to buttress a less-than-triumphant present. Taunting Germany about defeat, whether on the battlefield or the football pitch, became as much a part of being British as complaining about a wet summer.
Britain’s need to draw on the past to buttress the present is probably more urgent than it was 30 years ago. But, as Leave.EU discovered, anti-German chauvinism no longer provides the resources necessary for the task.
The irony is that for many people, Germany stands condemned today not for its historic Nazism but for its contemporary liberalism. Angela Merkel’s decision in 2015 to open the borders to migrants and refugees, and its role in helping the growth of the far right, reveals for many the dangers of an overweening liberalism, that, in their eyes, has unleashed darker forces – witness the attack last week, during Yom Kippur, on a synagogue in the German city of Halle by a far-right gunman. This view of the supposed liberalism of Germany and the EU over immigration is, as I have argued, disturbingly mistaken, as are the claims about the reasons for the rise of the far right. The shift in British perceptions of Germany is nevertheless expressive of the wider recasting of political attachments and faultlines.
Brexit has thrown into turmoil not simply traditional political alignments but also Britain’s understanding of itself and of its place in the world. From debates about “global Britain” to worries about the union, the question of what Britain stands for seems less certain. The past has become a battlefield in the struggle to define the present. The bicentenary of the Peterloo massacre in August was, for instance, notable for attempts by both Brexiters and Remainers to claim its legacy as their own, to draw from the 19th-century struggle for democracy lessons for the meaning of democracy today.
The shifting perceptions of Germany also speak to this contestation over the past. The Second World War has helped anchor Britain’s sense of itself as a nation, not just as the last moment when it could act as a world power but also because the Holocaust provided an unalloyed moral symbol of evil.
In her book Learning From the Germans, the philosopher Susan Neiman observes that the enormity of the Holocaust has forced Germany to address the darkest aspects of its past. But it has also allowed Britain and America not to do so, to avoid thinking too deeply about the history of slavery or of empire, to minimise their horrors in comparison with the Holocaust.
The turmoil over Brexit is throwing many of the old certainties into question. The question is – will we use that uncertainty to have a grown-up debate about history and identity?

On a sunny afternoon in Berlin’s Bergmannkiez neighbourhood, workers are moving boxes of mince pies, chocolate oranges and Christmas puddings into a soon-to-open shop.
For 24 years, Broken English used to be the German capital’s premier retailer of British delicacies and UK-themed souvenirs – until its owner threw in the towel at the start of this year: in interviews, she said she couldn’t face the hassle of having to fill in thousands of customs forms after Brexit.
Antje Blank, the shop’s new owner, is a German-born Anglophile with a Norfolk accent who couldn’t face the prospect of Berliners missing out on proper scones and thick-cut marmalade. She’s now stockpiling to make sure she can meet the cravings of expats and other lovers of British Christmas treats in case of a no-deal Brexit.
Blank is aware of the gamble she is taking: a nearby travel agency specialising in trips to the UK, she said, had recently shifted its focus on selling holidays to Ireland instead. She has already decided not to decorate the shopfront with a Union Jack: “The flag is too tied up with Nigel Farage, too tied up with anti-EU and anti-German feelings,” she said. “For a while, we considered hanging a Scottish flag outside.”
The frost that has descended on Anglo-German relations since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 has rarely felt as icy as it did last week. In a phone call on Tuesday morning, British prime minister Boris Johnson and German chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly failed to find common ground to avert a chaotic British exit from the EU, and even if the mood between Brussels and Westminster appears to have warmed a degree or two since then, the impact of the call and how it was handled afterwards will continue to make its mark in Berlin.
In a number of extraordinary briefings about the confidential discussion, a No 10 source said Merkel had demanded that Northern Ireland remain in a customs union with the EU “for ever”, making a deal look “essentially impossible, not just now but ever” to the UK side.
Reports of the call were pounced on by Brexit campaign group Leave.EU, which tweeted out an image reminiscent of wartime propaganda posters, saying: “We didn’t win two world wars to be pushed around by a Kraut,” next to a photo of Merkel with her arm aloft.
The image was accompanied by a line reading: “Angela Merkel’s demand that Britain leaves Northern Ireland to rot inside the customs union is reprehensible and shows the true colours of our supposed ‘European allies’.” Uncharacteristically, Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks later apologised for the image.
Merkel declined to comment on the British accounts of the call, but behind closed doors, some German lawmakers and diplomats said they considered the read-outs of the call a major breach of protocol. “By publishing the contents of the call, whether they are true or not, Johnson is likely to have gambled away all his credit with the chancellor,” wrote her biographer Stefan Kornelius in Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
While it is true that embarrassing details from the 2017 meeting of Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, with European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker were leaked to a German newspaper, Merkel’s chancellory is generally a leak-proof place, and her advisers are notoriously discreet in their dealings with the press. “She won’t forgive such a breach of trust, even if she probably won’t ever comment on it,” Kornelius wrote. “In 14 years as chancellor, she has certainly been rarely made such a spectacle of.”
The incident has prompted historians to reach far back into European history in search of comparable moments of diplomatic breakdown. Mareike Kleine, a political scientist at Berlin’s Freie Universität and the London School of Economics, said she was reminded of a famous incident in 1870, known as the “Ems dispatch”, when the French ambassador told Wilhelm, then king of Prussia and later Kaiser Wilhelm I, that Prussia should ditch its aspirations for the Spanish throne.
Wilhelm then gave the task of briefing the public with an account of the conversation to his chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, who deliberately cut out conciliatory language and dramatised the confrontational aspect, thus causing outrage on both the German and the French side.
“Bismarck wanted a hastened response from an enemy, who had overestimated his powers,” said Kleine. “His plan worked: the French launched themselves into a war they decisively lost, and in the process Prussia managed to bring the independent southern German states into the fold.”
Johnson’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings, suspected by many to be the source the source behind the leaks of the Merkel call, has in numerous expansive blog entries expressed his fascination with the ways the Prussian chancellor’s tactics “upended Europe”.
“But if someone in Britain really was trying to take a leaf out of Bismarck’s book, it didn’t work,” said Kleine. “Merkel didn’t rise to the challenge like the French did.”
Some historians fear the events of last week could mark a shift for the worse in Anglo-German relations.
“Two narratives have dominated the view of Germany in the Brexit debate,” said Helene von Bismarck, a Hamburg-based historian specialising in British foreign policy. “There are the good Germans who will come to Britain’s rescue during the negotiations, and there are the bad Germans who are pushing us around in Europe.”
“[Last] week Downing Street gave legitimacy to the second narrative, which was predominantly used by the extreme fringe of the Brexit debate. The briefing will further poison British perceptions of Germany, and will thereby harm the Anglo-German relationship.”
This is indeed a breach of trust, but it's not like Johnson had a reputation of being trustworthy before this happened
As for the German reaction, said von Bismarck (a distant relative to Otto von Bismarck by marriage), “this is indeed a breach of trust, but it is not like Johnson had a reputation of being trustworthy before this happened.” The incident, she noted, had not gained as much attention in Germany as in Britain.
Richard J Evans, former regius professor of history at Cambridge University, agreed that Brexit has interfered with two strains of British thinking about its North Sea neighbours.
“Britain’s view of Germany has oscillated historically between two different models. On one hand, there was the ‘good Germany’ of Beethoven and Goethe, the land of poets and thinkers. On the other, there was the view of Germany as an aggressive threat: first economic, then military. In the 1970s and 80s, during the wide-ranging debate on the ‘decline of Britain’, the two images were briefly fused, when the British began to admire German efficiency in industry, holding up Vorsprung durch Technik as a motto to emulate, uncoupling it from the fear of Germany as a political power,” Evans said.
“But since reunification in 1990 the ‘bad Germany’ has dominated in the British mind again. Fear of German domination in Europe became a symbolic expression of euroscepticism, presenting a mythical image of Britain standing alone against Europe in 1940 and again in the 21st century.”
In turn, Evans said, Britain’s tortuous process of extracting itself from the EU has begun to change the German view of Britain. “Among German liberals, in the broader sense of the word, British institutions and qualities such as pragmatism and common sense have been held up as the more desirable alternative to the French revolutionary model since at least 1848. Brexit has thrown all that into question.”
At Berlin’s Broken English shop, Antje Blank remains optimistic that Tetley tea and Colman’s Mustard will sustain their appeal as political ties are strained. “There is still a large Anglophile community with a longing for rolling hills, Shakespeare and Jane Austen,” she said. “A lot of Germans think Britain has gone a little bit bonkers, but it will be all right in the end.”

In light of everything that was known about Boris Johnson before becoming prime minister, his inability to resolve Brexit once installed in Downing Street was to be expected. Only the manner of his failure was unpredictable. Mr Johnson was lazy in his assessment of the EU negotiating position, arrogant in his handling of parliament, and complacent about the strength of opposition there. But perhaps the prime minister’s most damaging error has been to confuse campaign rhetoric with the reality of government.
Mr Johnson believed the arguments he used to persuade Tory members to elect him as their leader. He said that Theresa May’s deal was obsolete and that a better deal would be available if the UK listened less to Brussels. That proposition has now been tested and found to be false. Mr Johnson’s alternative Brexit proposals have been rejected. It is not clear whether Downing Street intended its plan to be the starting point for a serious negotiation or just a provocation – designed for rejection ahead of a campaign vilifying foreigners as the obstacles to Brexit liberation.
The more cynical view is supported by an anonymous briefing, sourced to No 10, narrating a telephone call in which Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, appeared to demand that Mr Johnson surrender Northern Ireland to Brussels. No one who is familiar with Mrs Merkel’s style of diplomacy imagines that Downing Street accurately reflected what was said. The purpose of such a briefing was to make compromise less likely and stoke international enmity for tactical domestic advantage. It is unclear whether Mr Johnson authorised that message but it hardly matters. He is responsible for his messengers and they are sabotaging the UK’s relationship with vital European allies.
A root of the problem is the recruitment to Downing Street of leading figures from the Vote Leave referendum campaign, including its executive strategist Dominic Cummings. That clique is not respectful of Conservative traditions and, in the case of Mr Cummings, despises any sentimental attachment to established modes of governance. That ethos is incompatible with the side of Downing Street that wants to be an orthodox Tory administration, engaging with parliament, maintaining relations with neighbouring states and preserving a semblance of sober statecraft. Those ambitions lead some of the prime minister’s staff and cabinet colleagues to seek a Brexit deal.
As a leadership candidate, Mr Johnson did not foresee a clash between the Vote Leave model of relentless campaigning aggression and the day-to-day conduct of grown-up government. He now faces a choice, crystallised in the question of whether to submit to the Benn Act, which requires that the government seek an article 50 extension in the absence of a deal. A responsible prime minister would obey the law (or resign if he felt unable to do so). But Downing Street has let it be known that other notions are under consideration. There are hints at unidentified ruses, suggesting the law might not be so legally binding.
Even if the courts compelled compliance, forcing their hand would allow Mr Johnson to portray himself as a Brexit martyr. He might then be in a stronger position to run as the tribune of the people, defying a Europhile establishment in parliament and the judiciary. That is the stuff of authoritarian subversion, and should not appear in the repertoire of democratic politicians.
Mr Johnson is not yet at that point, but it is within sight. The prospects of agreement with the EU look remote. The decision to hold an emergency Saturday session of parliament on 19 October, an expedient usually limited to wartime, looks designed to aggravate, not calm, the sense of national emergency. But the prime minister’s choice reveals a more profound conflict at the heart of Downing Street. He has chosen a strategy for fighting an election that requires behaviour unsuitable for running a government. He can be a wrecking candidate, attacking diplomatic, constitutional and democratic norms, or he can be a serious head of government. He can submit to the rule of law or he can pose as a lord of misrule. He cannot do both."

Arron Banks has apologised after Leave.EU tweeted a xenophobic meme of Angela Merkel that invoked Britain’s world war victories to target the German chancellor.
The image was condemned by cross-party MPs and later deleted by the pro-Brexit campaign group, but the businessman and Leave.EU co-founder initially defended it. The meme, which was reminiscent of wartime propaganda posters, said: “We didn’t win two world wars to be pushed around by a Kraut,” alongside a photo of Merkel stood with her arm aloft.
It was accompanied by a comment saying: “Angela Merkel’s demand that Britain leaves Northern Ireland to rot inside the customs union is reprehensible and shows the true colours of our supposed ‘European allies’.”
The furore came after a No 10 source said Merkel’s demands for Northern Ireland after Brexit had made a deal “essentially impossible”, leading to accusations that Boris Johnson was trying to play a “stupid blame game”.
In the Commons on Tuesday, the Independent Group for Change MP Chris Leslie criticised the “deliberate dog-whistle briefing” and warned of its consequences.
“It has sparked a series of frankly racist attacks against the Germans, from Leave.EU and others,” he said. “This is an extremely dangerous course for the government to embark on, and I want to hear – right now – the minister condemn and distance himself from it.”
Michael Gove, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, dissociated himself from “any sort of racist or demeaning language towards Germany” and said he had reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to friendship at a German day of national unity event at the country’s embassy last week.
“The Germans are our friends and our allies, and Germany is a great country,” he told MPs, after politicians from across the spectrum had earlier criticised the image.
The Labour MP David Lammy tweeted: “Dear Germany and the EU, please accept our apologies and do not be fooled into thinking Leave.EU’s xenophobic bile is representative of the UK. A clear majority of Brits now oppose Brexit in all its forms. A vast, young and vibrant pro-EU movement in Britain stands with you.”
The Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson, Tom Brake, said the advert was “insulting and offensive”.
“Language such as this is stoking divisions within our society and should not be considered acceptable,” he said. “EU citizens are our neighbours, friends and family. This demonstrates the depths that Leave.EU will go to as they try and tear our country apart.”
Banks tweeted an apology on Wednesday morning, saying: “The Leave.EU team went too far yesterday but the real outrage is the German suggestion that Northern Ireland be separated from the UK. As a result we will delete the post and apologise accordingly … on reflection the point could have been made better.”
Leave.EU retweeted the post as it said: “We’re sorry.”"

The European Union is poised to extend Brexit talks into as late as next summer after the European council and commission presidents dismissed Boris Johnson’s strategy as a “blame game”.
A “range of dates” will now be in play at the meeting of European leaders next week but sources suggested the natural cut-off date would be June.
With an extension of the UK’s EU membership now looking inevitable, other diplomatic sources suggested an unlikely outlier for an end date could even be ahead of a possible general election so as to force the Commons into accepting a deal. “But politicians like to keep things off their plates for as long as possible and so pushing it longer seems more realistic,” a senior EU diplomat said.
The negotiations over a deal are said to be effectively dead in Brussels after Downing Street’s extraordinary claims over the substance of a phone call between the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the UK prime minister.
Merkel was said by an unnamed UK source to have told Johnson that Northern Ireland had to stay in the EU’s customs union. The official claimed that as a consequence a deal looked “essentially impossible, not just now but ever”.
Tusk, the European council president, gave an insight into the frustration at the anonymous briefings over the Merkel call, the alleged content of which described by senior politicians in Berlin as “improbable”. The chancellor’s spokesman declined to comment on “confidential conversations”.
“What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,” Tusk wrote in a tweet directed at the prime minister. “At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don’t want a deal, you don’t want an extension, you don’t want to revoke. Quo vadis? [Where are you going?]”
The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said: “I do not accept this ‘blame game’ of pinning the eventual failure of the negotiations on the EU.
“If that’s the case the explanation is actually in the British camp because the original sin is on the islands and not on the continent.
“Nobody would come out a winner in this scenario. A no-deal Brexit would lead to a decline of the UK and a clear weakening of the roots of growth on the continent.”
Juncker said that Johnson’s Brexit proposals would leave the UK with a relationship with the EU that was “less intimate than with Canada”.
In Berlin Detlef Seif, the point person on Brexit for Merkel’s party, the CDU, rejected the account given by Downing Street of the call between the two leaders.
He said: “In my mind it is completely improbable that the phone call between Merkel and Johnson took place in the way it has been reported in the British media.
“It would run counter to all the principles the German government has followed for the last three years, namely that the negotiations are led by the European commission.
“For the German chancellor to insist on Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union would completely breach these guidelines.”
Germany has been one of the most outspoken advocates for allowing the UK as much flexibility as possible to avoid a no-deal scenario on 31 October or at a later date.
The unnamed Downing Street briefings have been widely attributed to Dominic Cummings, the former Vote Leave supremo who is now the prime minister’s chief adviser.
“There has been a lot of scepticism about Johnson’s proposal in Berlin, but Merkel’s attitude has always been a positive one, to find out if there is room for a compromise,” Sief said.
“The only explanation I can see for these reports is that Johnson is trying to build a story where he blames Germany for a no-deal Brexit. To brief out a confidential phone call in such a manner is utterly unprofessional and infuriating to anyone who has been working on a deal”.
On Tuesday, Johnson spoke to the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, in a 40 minute call and agreed to meet later this week in what will be seen as a last-ditch chance to find a deal.
The briefings attributed to Cummings had suggested that Varadkar had gone back on his word by attacking Johnson’s proposals for the Irish border, which involve a customs border on the island of Ireland and Northern Ireland staying in the single market for goods.
In Brussels, thinking is moving to how to react to what is seen as an inevitable request for an extension of the UK’s EU membership.
A debate among EU27 states over the end date for any extension is yet to take place.
Following a meeting with Johnson in No 10 on Tuesday, the European parliament’s president, David Sassoli, said there had been “no progress” in talks but MEPs were open to a Brexit extension.
Johnson has repeatedly said that he will not comply with the Benn act, which would instruct him to request an extension by 19 October if a deal is not secured with the EU. He has also insisted that the UK will leave on 31 October with or without a deal.
The unnamed source had suggested to the Spectator magazine on Monday night that the UK would be a truculent member, blocking the EU’s plans.
But the only key issue on which the UK could wield its veto would be the EU’s seven-year budget which is unlikely to come to a vote until June, or September at the latest. “We could extend to September without any problem, but what would you achieve over the summer? So June seems more likely,” said an EU diplomat.
“Beyond the UK being able to veto a budget, an end date by then is important because we don’t want the UK to be in and net recipients to be able to argue that there is no reason for a cut to the budget.”
The Benn act suggests an extension until the end of January 2020 but there will be some concern in EU capitals that this will not provide sufficient time for any fallout from a general election to play out."

The first sign of trouble was in the dawn news bulletins. In a long missive the Spectator published overnight, an anonymous No 10 source – widely presumed to be Dominic Cummings – predicted that Brexit talks would “probably end this week”, blaming the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who, it was claimed, had “gone very cold”. The nameless source warned that EU countries supporting an extension of article 50 “will go to the bottom of the queue” on future cooperation with the UK.
While the incendiary briefing was being condemned on the airwaves as “desperate” and something to make the government “ashamed” by the recently departed cabinet minister Amber Rudd, Boris Johnson was on the phone to Angela Merkel. Neither London nor Berlin would offer any detailed official account of their phone call, in line with diplomatic protocol. Yet, by 10am, another explosive anonymous briefing from a No 10 source was lighting up social media with incredible claims about what the German chancellor was meant to have said. And, with that, the Brexit blame game had gone into full swing.
The unknown figure in Downing Street claimed Merkel was making a deal “essentially impossible not just now but for ever” by insisting that Northern Ireland must remain in full regulatory alignment and a customs union. At his regular lobby briefing at midday, Boris Johnson’s official spokesman refused – or was unable – to say whether this was an accurate description of the meeting or represented No 10’s official position.
He was listening to the phone call between Johnson and Merkel, he acknowledged, but he would only tell reporters that it had been a “full and frank exchange” – a coded way of saying there had been an argument between the two leaders. Diplomatic protocol dictates that the official spokesman never comments on remarks made by a foreign leader in a confidential phone call, making the No 10 source’s briefing all the more remarkable.
Donald Tusk had read the reports while travelling to Berlin. The European council president was going to see Merkel at the chancellery as part of a routine tour of European capitals before next week’s EU summit, where Brexit is again crowding out the agenda. Tusk, an anglophile former Polish prime minister with a sharp turn of phrase, has been deeply frustrated by what he sees as Downing Street’s attempt to avoid responsibility.
As his car headed to the chancellery, he decided it was time to hit back and accused Johnson directly of playing “some stupid blame game” and making a deal impossible. “Where are you going?” he asked in Latin.
He was not alone in that view. In Brussels, European diplomats were aghast at what they saw as the No 10 spin machine out of control. “It’s incredibly immature. Kids in the kindergarten behave more maturely than this,” one senior diplomat said of the latest No 10 briefings. “It’s amazing, that’s all I can say.”
The diplomat told the Guardian it might be better to simply ignore the statements, suggesting they could not represent the strategy of a serious country. “This is so strange and immature. This can’t be government policy, this can’t be a majority opinion in Downing Street.”
The same diplomat described No 10’s account of the call with Merkel as “an incredible distortion of facts”, saying she would have repeated the EU’s longstanding position that a customs border was not compatible with the UK’s obligations under the Good Friday agreement.
Another diplomat described No 10’s account of the call as “quite shocking”, pointing to claims that Merkel had apparently said Germany could leave the EU “no problem” if it wanted. “She would never have mentioned Germany leaving the EU - it’s quite gross and ridiculous,” the diplomat said. “For me, it was obvious that it was designed for a domestic audience but, at the same time, how could they attribute that to the chancellor?”
Not everyone agrees with Tusk’s blazing Twitter diplomacy. Some diplomats prefer the quiet German approach. A German government spokesman declined to comment on the Merkel-Johnson call, noting: “As usual, we do not report from such confidential conversations.” Privately, Berlin has long argued it would go the last kilometre for a Brexit deal, but not by jeopardising peace in Northern Ireland or the integrity of the EU single market.
Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, later took aim at the shadowy nature of these briefings, saying it reflected a prime minister who did not take responsibility for his No 10 operation. A Labour MP, Alison McGovern, said it was as though “the future of our country is being briefed out as political gossip”.
Behind the scenes, there was some disquiet among cabinet ministers about the briefings, especially the claim in the Spectator that the UK would withdraw security cooperation from any EU state that agrees to extend article 50. Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, even publicly tweeted that this idea was unacceptable.
As the day’s political storm was abating, Johnson’s chief envoy, David Frost, was leaving the European commission after two days of technical talks. Ensconced in the commission’s star-shaped Berlaymont headquarters, EU officials have for days bombarded Frost and his team with questions, covering customs checks, exemptions for small and medium-sized businesses, agri-food regulations, timelines and transitions – the technical minutiae of a very political deal.
Despite the furore, both sides insist talks have not broken down. But with the EU’s unofficial end-of-week deadline looming, they are going nowhere. In months and years to come, historians may look back on this day of febrile briefings as the moment an always elusive October deal slipped out of grasp."

A public row serves the government’s purpose
European governments have been justifiably sceptical about Boris Johnson’s approach to Brexit negotiations. After Tuesday’s extraordinary developments, scepticism may have hardened into the certainty that they are dealing with a government willing to risk a no-deal future in order to win a general election. According to a briefing from a No 10 aide, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told the prime minister that “the UK cannot leave [the EU] without leaving Northern Ireland behind in a customs union and in full alignment for ever”. The source added that this made a deal look impossible now and in the long term. Earlier, another off-the-record steer from Downing Street had suggested that if negotiations broke down, the Conservative party would fight an election on a no-deal ticket.
In Berlin, a government spokesman refused to comment on the Merkel-Johnson phone call. In Brussels, officials said they did not recognise the comments attributed to Ms Merkel as EU policy. The European council president, Donald Tusk, was more forthright, tweeting directly to the prime minister: “What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.”
Whatever was actually said, this crunch week of negotiations has morphed into precisely that, because of Downing Street’s decision to brief in such incendiary fashion. It will be hard to row back from here, as evidence mounts that a breakdown in negotiations is something Mr Johnson and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, are ready to actively seek, as long as they can pin it on the perfidy of the EU. The truth is that the government probably still wants a deal, not least to avoid the chaotic and dangerous consequences that its own plan, Operation Yellowhammer, identified. But its “two borders for four years” plan – requiring single-market checks between Britain and Northern Ireland, and customs checks on the island of Ireland – is almost certainly not going to be the basis for one. As has been made clear from the outset of negotiations, the EU will not countenance the physical infrastructure that would necessarily accompany such checks in Ireland, creating a de facto border and undermining the Good Friday agreement.
Given this reality, Mr Johnson may be refocusing on what has been his overwhelming priority all along: winning a general election. If negotiations break down, Mr Johnson is obliged by the Benn act to seek an extension to the 31 October deadline. In any subsequent election, he will need to convince furious leave voters that it wasn’t his fault he failed to deliver. It may well serve this purpose for the meltdown to be as acrimonious as possible, with the EU, as well as parliament, in the dock. That would allow an election to be fought on a no-deal platform, neutralising the threat from Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, in the expectation that the remain vote will stay split.
On Tuesday night parliament was again prorogued – lawfully on this occasion – ahead of the Queen’s speech next week. When it reconvenes on Monday, it will still be true that a majority in the House of Commons opposes no deal. It will still be true that a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is illegal. If talks on a deal do collapse this week, MPs must ensure that parliamentary sovereignty over the process is upheld. That is the first task. But given Tuesday’s developments, which once again revealed this government’s dangerous disregard for the national interest, that seems likely to be only the beginning of the battle to prevent no deal."

Talks over a Brexit deal are on the brink of collapse, as a No 10 source said that Angela Merkel was making a deal impossible and Brussels accused Boris Johnson of trying to play a “stupid blame game”.
The row erupted after Johnson and Merkel had a phone conversation in which they could not find a common position over Northern Ireland.
In an extraordinary briefing about the confidential discussion between the leaders, a No 10 source later said the German chancellor’s demands for Northern Ireland to remain in a customs union made a deal look “essentially impossible, not just now but ever”.
The briefing prompted a frustrated reaction from Donald Tusk, the European council president, who tweeted directly at Johnson: “What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don’t want a deal, you don’t want an extension, you don’t want to revoke. Quo vadis? [Where are you going?]”
Downing Street officially insists the government is still focused on getting a deal with the EU, with preliminary talks continuing about Johnson’s new Brexit proposals. However, the anonymous No 10 source spoke to broadcast journalists, saying Merkel “made clear a deal is overwhelmingly unlikely and she thinks the EU has a veto on us leaving the customs union”.
“Merkel said that if Germany wanted to leave the EU they could do it no problem, but the UK cannot leave without leaving Northern Ireland behind in a customs union and in full alignment forever,” the source said.
“She said Ireland is the government’s special problem and Ireland must at least have a veto on NI leaving. Merkel said the PM should tell Northern Ireland it must stay in full alignment forever but that even this would not eliminate customs issues.
“It was a very useful clarifying moment in all sorts of ways. If this represents a new established position then it means a deal is essentially impossible, not just now but ever. It also made clear that they are willing to torpedo the Good Friday agreement.”
Berlin declined to give its side of the conversation. A German government spokesperson said: “I can confirm that the German chancellor and the British prime minister spoke on the phone this morning. As usual, we do not report from such confidential conversations.”
In response to Tusk’s tweet, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, tweeted: “Hard to disagree – reflects the frustration across EU and the enormity of what’s at stake for us all. We remain open to finalise a fair Brexit deal but need a UK government willing to work with EU to get it done.”
Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said the account of the meeting “reveals the real objective of Dublin and the European Union” to trap Northern Ireland in a customs union.
“For the United Kingdom to be asked to leave a part of its sovereign territory in a foreign organisation of which the UK would no longer be a part and over which we would have no say whatsoever is beyond crazy. No UK government could ever concede such a surrender,” she said.
Brussels sources said they did not recognise the comments attributed to Merkel as being the agreed policy of the EU. A European commission spokeswoman insisted the EU was protecting the Good Friday agreement “in all its dimensions”.
She said: “The EU position has not changed. We want a deal. We are working for a deal with the UK and in no circumstances will we accept that the EU wants to harm the Good Friday agreement. The purpose of our work is to protect it in all its dimensions and at all times.”
Johnson’s official spokesman refused to comment on the anonymous briefing from within No 10 but he did acknowledge that the call between Merkel and Johnson had been “frank” and argued that the EU needed to compromise. He added: “The PM’s position is a clear one. It is not acceptable that Northern Ireland be left in the EU’s customs union.”
However, the anonymous briefings are causing some consternation within the cabinet, particularly one messsage to the Spectator on Monday that suggested the UK could withdraw security cooperation from countries that agree to a Brexit extension. Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, clarified that he thought this was not acceptable: “I am clear that any threat on withdrawing security cooperation with Ireland is unacceptable. This is not in the interest of NI or the union.”
With No 10 still insisting a no-deal Brexit was possible, the government published a 150-page document outlining its “Brexit readiness”.
Instead of the apocalyptic warnings of shortages, bottlenecks and increased prices contained in the Operation Yellowhammer documents published earlier this year, the report stresses the intensive preparations the government has carried out. These include increasing border staff and briefing more than 800 businesses at no-deal Brexit events.
Michael Gove, who was due to make a statement in parliament presenting the report, said: “It is the top priority of this government, and principal focus of my job, to get ready for Brexit on 31 October with or without a deal. We would prefer to leave with a deal, and continue to work in an energetic and determined way to achieve one, but we must be prepared for all eventualities.”
He added: “At every point, the government will be candid about any further challenges ahead as well as clear-eyed about the opportunities.”
If the UK is poised to give up on talks, Johnson is likely to be heading for an election fought on a platform of delivering a no-deal Brexit in late November or early December.
Labour has said it will agree to an election only after Johnson has secured a three-month extension to article 50, ruling out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. No 10 insists a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is still possible, but it is more likely his government will be forced, potentially through the courts, to request and accept a delay.
Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said Downing Street was engaged in a “cynical attempt to sabotage the negotiations”.
“Boris Johnson will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal. His strategy from day one has been for a no-deal Brexit,” he said. “It is now more important than ever that parliament unites to prevent this reckless government crashing us out of the EU at the end of the month.”"

A No 10 source who said the German chancellor Angela Merkel’s demands for Northern Ireland after Brexit had made a deal “essentially impossible” has sparked furious exchanges on social media between prominent politicians.
Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, criticised Johnson directly, tweeting it was not about “winning some stupid blame game”.
.@BorisJohnson, what’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don’t want a deal, you don’t want an extension, you don’t want to revoke, quo vadis?
Citing the contrast between Johnson’s repeated assurances that he wants a deal, and the substance of his proposals, Tusk said: “You don’t want a deal, you don’t want an extension, you don’t want to revoke. Quo vadis? [Where are you going?]”
Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, was also unimpressed.
The UK government’s attempt to shift the blame for the Brexit fiasco to anyone but themselves - today it’s Merkel - is pathetically transparent.
The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, struck a strident tone, suggesting the UK now had a choice between “a clean break Brexit” or “to stay in a new militarised empire”.
No British Government could ever accept Germany telling us that part of the UK has to stay in the EU. The choice now is clear: A clean break Brexit, or stay in a new militarised empire. Time to choose freedom.
The Brexit party’s recent party political broadcast included a section that heavily implied the withdrawal agreement negotiated between Theresa May and EU, upon which it said Boris Johnson would base his deal, signed the country up for military cooperation. It also incorrectly called into question the UK’s ability to unilaterally declare war.
Earlier, responding to the unofficial No 10 briefing published on James Forsyth’s Spectator blog, which implied the UK might withhold security cooperation from EU countries that backed a Brexit extension, the Green party’s Caroline Lucas described the government’s position as “as close to blackmail as it gets”.
This is as close to blackmail as it getsNot content with being determined to destroy UK businesses, jobs etc, Govt now threatens to sabotage the EUThis is no way to secure a #Brexit deal, and proof that the Govt doesn't want one pic.twitter.com/C8NxZ9i6WU
The Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, issued more of a dissenting line to the bellicose no-deal rhetoric, saying that “any threat on withdrawing security cooperation with Ireland is unacceptable.”.
I am clear that any threat on withdrawing security cooperation with Ireland is unacceptable. This is not in the interest of NI or the Union.
Labour’s shadow defence secretary was also unequivocal on the matter of security cooperation.
The primary duty of any govt is to ensure the safety and security of its citizens. Threats to end defence and security cooperation with our European and NATO partners are reckless and dangerous. Labour is firmly committed to NATO and to ensuring peace and stability in Europe. https://t.co/wxqS7Arz7U"

Boris Johnson is set to launch a whirlwind round of talks in European Union capitals as he tries to sell his new Brexit proposals to sceptical EU leaders, while also keeping intact an emerging if fragile House of Commons majority for the plan.
The prime minister had been expected to head to Berlin for talks with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Friday. However, scheduling difficulties mean discussions are more likely to begin at the weekend, Downing Street sources said, with trips planned to “several” capitals.
However, no face-to-face talks have yet been confirmed, with Emmanuel Macron’s office saying that the French president was not due to see Johnson at the weekend or next week.
In the interim, Johnson held phone talks on Friday with the European council president, Donald Tusk, as well as Merkel, the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker.
Johnson’s chief negotiator, David Frost, has already started what Downing Street termed “technical talks” with his EU counterparts in Brussels, going over the as-yet unpublished draft legal protocol submitted by London.
Formally presenting his plans to the Commons on Thursday, Johnson took a noticeably more conciliatory tone than during a furious debate last week, even as Jeremy Corbyn condemned the proposals as a “Trump-deal Brexit” that would risk regulatory standards.
In contrast, several hardline Brexiters among Tory MPs were cautiously positive about Johnson’s plan. Steve Baker, chair of the European Research Group, told the prime minister: “We now glimpse the possibility of a tolerable deal.”
The PM has the beginnings of a parliamentary majority, with the DUP onboard and a handful of Labour MPs from strongly pro-leave constituencies indicating they could back a deal based on Johnson’s plan. However, it all hinges on whether EU member states are willing.
Among many balancing acts for Johnson in the coming days will be how much room for manoeuvre he has to offer concessions to the EU without dissolving the fragile parliamentary alliance forming around his plan.
Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister hinted that he was not willing to budge especially far. Asked by Alistair Burt, the former Foreign Office minister who was among 21 Tory MPs who lost the party whip for rebelling last month, whether further compromise was likely, Johnson said the UK had already “gone the extra mile”.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is a Northern Ireland unionist political party, founded by Ian Paisley in 1971. The party is currently led by Arlene Foster.
The DUP achieved their best ever general election performance in 2017, and have 10 of Northern Ireland’s 18 constituency MPs at Westminster, where they are led by Nigel Dodds. Since the election they have been supporting Theresa May’s Conservative government in a confidence-and-supply agreement.
The DUP supported leave in the EU referendum, and have repeatedly expressed their concerns over the provisions for an Irish border backstop. This led to them voting against Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement with the EU in parliament’s three ‘meaningful votes’. Getting them to back any new Boris Johnson Brexit plan for the island of Ireland is seen as key to him getting parliamentary backing for a deal.
Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU.
Devolution and power-sharing in Northern Ireland, where the DUP had held the position of First Minister since 2007, collapsed in January 2017, and has not been restored despite several attempts, most recently in the wake of the murder of journalist Lyra McKee.

“People should be reminded that what the UK has done is already very considerable,” he said. “We have already moved quite some way, and I hope that our friends and partners across the Channel do understand that.”
But at the same time, Downing Street moved away from its earlier briefed line that the proposal was a “final offer” to the EU. A Downing Street spokeswoman hinted at least some flexibility remained possible, reiterating Johnson’s talk about seeking a “broad landing zone”. She added: “The prime minister believes that we have made compromises in this deal but talks have just started today.”
In a noisily received Commons statement, Johnson began by explaining his idea of replacing the Irish backstop insurance policy with a somewhat sketchily outlined new regime of checks.
He insisted there would be no physical customs infrastructure anywhere in Northern Ireland: “The proposals we are putting forward do not involve physical infrastructure at or near the border – or indeed at any other place.”
Johnson said the “driving purpose” of the Irish border proposals was to minimise any disruption, saying that while some new customs checks would happen, none would take place near the border.
The new regime would allow the UK “to take back control of our trade policy and our regulations”, he said, arguing that he had made a considerable compromise, and that it was now up to the EU to do the same.
Responding, Corbyn called Johnson’s ideas “a rehashed version of previously rejected proposals” that were worse than Theresa May’s plan.
Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.
Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.
The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals.
There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.

Interactive: A typical hour in the life of the Irish border
Noting Johnson’s desire to move away from EU standards and push for a US trade accord, the Labour leader said: “Deal or no deal, this government’s agenda is clear. They want a Trump-deal Brexit that would crash our economy and rip away the standards that put a floor under people’s rights at work, that protect our environment and protect our consumers.
Corbyn cited the comments of a series of businesses leaders in Northern Ireland that the checks would badly hamper commerce. He said: “These proposals are nothing more than a cynical attempt by the prime minister to shift the blame for his failure to deliver.”
Corbyn added: “The only people who won’t suffer are the prime minister’s hedge fund donors who are currently betting against the pound and running down our fragile economy. He is doing nothing but seeking to divide and risking this country for his own political gain. An America-first deal with President Trump.”"

Angela Merkel’s government has promised more than half a billion euros to revitalise the country’s crisis-hit forests in the fight against climate change.
A third of Germany’s landmass is covered in woodland, and forests play an important role in the country’s national folklore, from the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm to the poems of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
But a combination of storms, drought, forest fires and aggressively spreading bark beetle plagues have so far this year destroyed swathes of German forest equivalent to more than 250,000 football fields, forcing the government to convene an emergency “forest summit”, held on Wednesday in Berlin.
“Every missing tree is a missing comrade-in-arms against climate change,” agriculture minister Julia Klöckner said ahead of the gathering of around 170 organisations representing both environmental groups and industry. “Whatever we don’t reforest today, our grandchildren will, of course, miss.”
In the face of the numerous challenges, Germany’s federal government has announced making available €547mover the next four years to remove dead trees and plant new ones, with state contributions boosting the emergency fund to €800m. The defence minister and CDU leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has pledged the military’s help with the effort.
Woodland owners however insist their trees deserve better financial compensation for cleaning polluted air.
Representatives of the country’s influential forestry industry – employing some 720,000 people, almost as many as the car sector – have already warned the funds won’t be enough to replace the forest that has been lost.
Umbrella organisation AGDW, representing forest owners and forestry workers, has called for direct investments of €2.3bn, as well as a new tax on industrial pollution that would help to subsidise forests at €125 a year per hectare of forest.
Trees absorb the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2), and their leaves can trap the toxic pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone, and harmful microscopic particles produced by diesel vehicles, cooking and wood burning. According to AGDW, Germany’s forest currently compensates 14% of the country’s CO2 emissions.
“Those who pollute our environment with dirt have to pay for it, and those who receive the dirt should be financially compensated in turn”, forest owner Ferdinand Graf von Westerholt told broadcaster ZDF. “That’s the solution.”
But even how the funds already made available can be used has become a divisive issue between landowner and environmentalists. The forestry industry proposes replanting areas of destroyed forest with some non-native species that are more suited to a drier and hotter climate, such as the Japanese larch, the North American Douglas fir or the northern red oak.
Environmental groups warn this could have a devastating impact on local wildlife, which could struggle to adapt to the new environment.
Hubert Weiger, chair of the German branch of Friends of the Earth said cash should be injected on “public money for public services” principle: “Taxpayers’ money should only be spent to build up natural broad-leaved deciduous forests made up of native species”."

Boris Johnson has signalled his hope to push down tax rates and diverge from EU standards and regulations after Brexit, even as his talks on a new departure plan at a UN summit in New York met with seemingly limited success.
The prime minister was expected to try to sell his self-styled replacement for the Irish backstop border insurance policy during two days of meetings with leaders from the EU and member states.
On Monday he held talks with Emmanuel Macron of France and Germany’s Angela Merkel, as well as Donald Tusk, the European council president, and Charles Michel, the Belgian prime minister.
After the 30-minute discussion, an EU spokesperson said there were “still big gaps in substance”.
“If there is to be a deal, there is little time left although no formal deadline,” the spokesperson said. “The EU will need realistic, operational proposals in legal form. The UK non-papers do not meet the objectives of the backstop.”
A UK government official said Johnson had made it clear Northern Ireland staying in some sort of backstop on its own was “not a solution that the UK government could accept”.
Tusk tweeted following the meeting: “No breakdown. No breakthrough. No time to lose.”
In another setback, while Johnson used a TV interview to call on the Republic of Ireland to potentially compromise over the border issue, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, whom Johnson was due to meet on Tuesday, poured cold water on the idea.
After talks at the UN general assembly with Tusk, Varadkar said Ireland would not accept a “halfway house” plan for the border.
“There are also some people that believe at the last minute that Ireland will somehow fold or give up our position and that’s not going to happen,” he said.
After the pair’s 45-minute meeting, Varadkar’s spokesman said he and Tusk agreed that the EU had still not seen any viable UK solutions to the Irish border and that “time is very short” if there was to be a deal by next month’s European council summit.
Speaking earlier, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, described Johnson’s solution for replacing the backstop as unacceptable, giving his most downbeat assessment yet of the chances of striking a Brexit deal by 31 October.
Standing alongside the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, following a meeting in Berlin, Barnier said the UK wanted a “regulatory and customs land border on the island of Ireland” and thus for the EU to change how the single market operated.
“As I am sure you will understand, this is unacceptable,” he said. “My mandate is clear of the 27 leaders, the EU and the European parliament, safeguarding peace and stability in Ireland and protecting the integrity of the single market.”
In what Downing Street has billed as Johnson’s setpiece Brexit speech in New York, on Tuesday morning he is to address US and Canadian businesspeople in the city’s plush and newly built Hudson Yards district.
According to extracts of the speech released in advance, Johnson will promise that a post-Brexit UK would “roll out the red carpet” for US businesses, with “the most competitive tax rates and the best skilled workforce in the hemisphere”.
“As we come out of the EU we are going up a gear,” he is due to say. “We are going to take advantage of all the freedoms that Brexit can give, whether that is new tax allowances for investment or speeding up public procurement contracts.”
In a round of TV interviews in New York, Johnson said examples where the UK could diverge from EU regulations in the future could be financial services or biotechnology, “where we want to do things different”.
He told Channel 4 News: “To give you another example, it may be that we want, for instance, to take advantage of tax freedoms to allow companies to invest more in capital and plant. We may want to do free ports in the UK to drive up economic growth in areas that have fallen behind.”
The EU has insisted it will not sign up to a deal that creates a regulatory and customs border on the island of Ireland, as proposed by the UK in the papers tabled last week by the government’s chief negotiator, David Frost.
Asked by Channel 4 if Ireland could help the impasse by, for example, accepting some UK regulations, Johnson called for movement on all sides.
“What I think is certainly a good thing is if everybody comes together to try to sort this out,” he said. “I think there’s an opportunity for us to get an agreement that really looks after the critical interests of everybody including Ireland.”
Talking to Sky News, Johnson argued that the UK proposal for a common Irish regulatory area for sanitary and phytosanitary products – mainly agriculture and food – was a major shift by London.
“I think possibly what’s becoming clear to people is that the UK has actually made a big offer when it comes to the unity of the sanitary and phytosanitary zone for the whole of Ireland. That’s a big concession by us, it’s an imaginative move,” he said."

Michel Barnier has described Boris Johnson’s solution for replacing the Irish backstop as “unacceptable” as the EU’s chief negotiator gave his most downbeat assessment yet of the chances of striking a Brexit deal by 31 October.
Standing alongside the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas following a meeting in Berlin, Barnier said the UK government’s position had to change for there to be any hope of success.
The British prime minister had declared on his way to New York for the UN general assembly that he was “cautiously optimistic” he could persuade key EU leaders to accept his proposals for the Irish border.
Johnson wants to find agreement on a deal ahead of an EU summit on 17 October that he can put to parliament in order for the UK to leave the bloc at the end of the month.
But as he sought to break the Brexit impasse by appealing to EU capitals and the European council’s president, Donald Tusk, Barnier appeared to scotch any hope of a rethink in Brussels.
The EU insists it will not sign up to a deal that creates a regulatory and customs border on the island of Ireland, as proposed by the UK in the papers tabled last week by the government’s chief negotiator, David Frost.
Barnier said: “The new government of the UK wants us to get rid of this solution, the so-called backstop and wants … a regulatory and customs land border on the island of Ireland.
“The UK government also wants the EU to change the way the internal market and border control operates after Brexit.
“As I am sure you will understand, this is unacceptable. My mandate is clear of the 27 leaders, the EU and the European parliament, safeguarding peace and stability in Ireland and protecting the integrity of the single market.
“Let me therefore put it clearly that based on current UK thinking, it is difficult to see how we arrive at a legally operable solution that fulfils all the objectives of the backstop.”
Barnier went on to insist the EU was open to “new ideas” should they be proposed. But he added that the talks were in a “very difficult sensitive phase”.
“The ball is in the court of the British,” he added.
The UK government has proposed maintaining an all-Ireland sanitary and phytosanitary zone for agrifood products to ensure that the flow of 30% by value of the trade across the border is unimpeded.
The EU has said this “partial” solution does not avoid additional customs and VAT checks on the island of Ireland nor deal with the issue of manufactured goods that cross the border after Brexit.
The backstop in the withdrawal agreement would in effect keep Northern Ireland in the single market and the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory in order to maintain peace, protect the north-south economy and avoid border infrastructure of even additional related checks.
Of the UK’s suggestion that customs paperwork could be done away from the border and that technology and trusted trade schemes could facilitate the necessary checks, Barnier and Maas raised doubts.
“Objectively, there are possibilities,” Barnier said, but added: “I don’t know how to inspect a cow with virtual methods.”
The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.
Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU’s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.
Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.
If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.

Maas said it was “progress” that the UK had at least made some proposals, but that “even from a British point of view these presented ideas are not a legal and viable solution”.
He added: “I have never believed that digitalisation can solve all problems … In the future what we will do is create a European position to this in close consultation with Michel Barnier. At this moment, all we can say is just that the suggestions are not legal or viable solutions as they have been agreed on in the exit agreement. But this would have to be the case.”
Johnson is meeting the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, along with Tusk while in the US."

When I was growing up there was no racism in Germany. In the 1980s every child learned at school that race was a construct that fascists had used to justify segregating and killing people. So if race didn’t exist, it naturally followed that racism didn’t exist either. If you wanted to talk about it people looked at you as if you were the Nazi.
All this is changing. It is dizzying to watch my motherland grapple with the concept of race. And, to be honest, to grapple with it myself because when you stop speaking about something you stop thinking about it eventually too. So we’re all walking on eggshells; the discussion about racism is on the agenda but we’re whispering “race” as if it were a dirty word. Except for members of Alternative für Deutschland, the far-right party, who keep pushing the boundaries of what you can and can’t say, and at every opportunity tout their worries about “other races” outbreeding white Germans. Germans of colour, meanwhile, worry about the AfD’s success in winning a quarter of the votes in recent state elections in Saxony and Brandenburg.
By the way, the German term for people of colour is: people of colour. We really haven’t got a language for it. When my father came from India to Germany in the 1960s he was called a Gastarbeiter, which translates as “guest worker”. Now, you wouldn’t ask your guests to work, and I wouldn’t, but the German government did. The idea was that people would come, they would do the jobs Germans didn’t want to do, and then they would go home.
In the 1980s these people had been living and working in Germany for decades and it was clear they weren’t going anywhere, so they became: foreigners. I became a foreigner, even though I was born in Germany. In the 1990s we became immigrants, even though … see above. The term immigrant later became shortened to migrant and then lengthened again to: person with a background of migration. For the first time the term made sense. Kind of. My father and my maternal grandparents migrated into Germany. But so did my husband. Yet nobody describes him in such terms because he’s a white Englishman.
Race does play a role in these difficult negotiations. This is exacerbated by the fact that German nationality law was based on the principle of jus sanguinis (“the right of blood”), meaning that you had to have German blood – or more specifically a German father – to be German. In 1975 the women’s movement won the right for German mothers to transmit their nationality to their children. But it wasn’t until 2000 that some children born and raised in Germany got the right to a German passport. Only in 2014 was the right extended to all German-born children.
Immediately the AfD claimed that we might have German passports but we would never be “real” Germans because we lacked that certain German essence – blood? – that would make us part of the Heimat. Sadly, I can’t translate Heimat as it is the unicorn of political language, (and a difficult term for many because it was used during the Nazi era) combining homeland, nation and identity in a mythical way.
So it was only a question of time before, last year, we got a unicorn ministry: the Heimatministerium, or federal homeland ministry. The freshly baked homeland minister, Horst Seehofer, did not belong to the AfD but to the governing CDU/CSU, yet still his first declaration was: “Islam does not belong to Germany.” Another way of telling millions of Germans that they didn’t belong here.
None of this is new. What is new is that it doesn’t go unchallenged any more. The populist propaganda that crime is being imported wholesale into Germany (especially sexual crime or the dark men raping white women trope) by “others” is now broadly contested on the basis that crime rates are actually falling in Germany. In fact, the people at highest risk of attack are women wearing hijabs. Seehofer was forced to add anti-Muslim hate crimes to the list of crimes his ministry evaluates statistically.
At the beginning of this month, Angela Merkel urged parliament to stand up against Fremdenfeindlichkeit, hatred of foreigners. This is great, only most people on the receiving end of hatred aren’t foreigners. They just happen to be brown or black or to have names like Muhammed or Mithu.
The idea that you don’t have to acquire German blood vampiristically but can achieve Germanness by … well, being German, is still new to us. All of us. We don’t call ourselves “people with a background of migration” any longer, we call ourselves “German plus” or “new Germans” or sometimes just Germans. And it feels weird. Because all our lives, we have been trained to view ourselves as other.
In response to the creation of the homeland ministry, 14 German Jewish and writers of colour, including myself, put together an anthology (inspired by the British Good Immigrant project) called Eure Heimat ist Unser Albtraum (Your Homeland is our Nightmare), which has kept a constructive debate going. To be fair, racism in Germany isn’t, in my experience, as blatant as it is in Britain. But there is also a lot less knowledge of it. When I go to England, sooner or later, somebody will remind me about the British empire. How could I forget? In Germany hardly anybody knows that we were dab hands at colonialism as well. We cling to the idea that we were too late to the game and anyway lost the colonies we supposedly didn’t have after the first world war.
But most of all we learn that we have already faced up to our past. That we are Weltmeisters in Erinnerungskultur, world champions in the politics of remembering, because we owned up to the crimes of the Nazis. And this is pretty special compared to other nations, even though it wasn’t as voluntary as we like to make out. And it is only part of the story. When we speak about concentration camps we should also know that we built the first concentration camp in 1904, in what is now Namibia, to intern and kill thousands of Herero and Nama people whose bodies were then sent to Berlin to be examined for racial research.
Last year, some of their skulls were given back to descendants in a ceremony that wasn’t an official apology for the genocide. It was, at least, an unofficial one.
It feels like more books about race have been published in the past two years in Germany than in the past two decades. We even have a sister hashtag to #metoo: #metwo for the experiences of people with more than one Heimat. Reading about all this can create the impression there is more racism than ever in Germany. Actually, the opposite is true. What’s happened is we are finally starting to talk about it.

Even for a government that prides itself on high-handedness, Jacob Rees-Mogg’s vicious attack on consultant neurologist David Nicholl was a low point. Dr Nicholl, who drew up a risk register for the newly released Yellowhammer no-deal Brexit planning document, asked Mr Rees-Mogg, on live radio, what “level of mortality” he would regard as an acceptable price for leaving the European Union with no arrangements in place. Since this was a direct challenge to ministers’ strategy of trying to normalise what should be unthinkable, Mr Rees-Mogg’s anger was not surprising. His insolence, however, in comparing Dr Nicholl to the struck-off anti-vaccination campaigner Andrew Wakefield, proved too much for his frontbench colleagues and Mr Rees-Mogg was forced to apologise.
Now that Yellowhammer has been published, it is clear why Dr Nicholl felt compelled to confront him. No-deal Brexit is a recipe for chaos, with medical supply shortages near the top of a list of consequences that are already scaring people around the country. While the long-term impact of a bitter divorce is strategically more damaging than any initial shocks, even voters tempted to buy into Mr Johnson’s no-deal bluster could be put off by the prospect of two-day traffic jams, energy price rises, civil unrest or a lack of clean water.
For Gibraltar and Northern Ireland the prospects are far bleaker, with a revived black market described as “likely”, particularly in border areas where criminals and terrorists are already active. Even given all the politics that surround Brexit, it is extraordinary that ministers thought it appropriate to hide such warnings from parliament and the public.
Both tips of the government’s two-pronged damage limitation exercise – that Yellowhammer represents a worst-case scenario, and that a deal is in any case on the cards – require careful handling. Since other versions of the Yellowhammer document are headed “base case”, it seems more likely that it sets out what civil servants believe will happen rather than what they think won’t (even if further attempts at mitigation are now in train), while the latest claims about a new deal being within view are at odds with the resignation statements of Amber Rudd and Jo Johnson.
Angela Merkel’s warning of the risk to the EU that could be posed by a low-tax, low-regulation “Singapore-on-Thames” on its doorstep is more illuminating. That such threats are being taken seriously, following Brexit negotiator David Frost’s announcement that Mr Johnson’s government wants to walk back from Theresa May’s commitment to a level playing field on social and environmental standards, should alarm everyone who wants the UK to continue in a constructive partnership with our neighbours, whether within or outside the EU. Given the enormous difficulties that would beset trade negotiations were the UK to pursue such a course, it is tempting to dismiss such statements as empty boasts, intended to force the EU’s hand with regard to Ireland. But Yellowhammer provides some support for this week’s complaint by a French foreign minister that the UK is attempting to negotiate “side deals” with individual member states, and subvert the Brussels process.
Since parliament has all but ruled out no deal, Yellowhammer’s predictions are not as frightening as they might be, even if an extension from the EU is not guaranteed. But it remains extremely disturbing that members of the prime minister’s immediate circle apparently believed, as recently as last weekend, that riots and shortages could be features of the near-future for which he is readying the country."

Angela Merkel has highlighted the economic danger posed by Britain if it is allowed to become a Singapore-on-Thames as Boris Johnson’s Brexit envoy outlined a plan to ditch the UK’s commitments to stay aligned to the EU’s social and environmental standards.
In talks with European commission officials, the prime minister’s negotiator, David Frost, insisted that the UK is seeking a “clean break” from an array of the bloc’s regulations, a policy choice from the new British government that has caused alarm in other EU capitals.
As the UK’s new vision was laid out in Brussels, the German chancellor, speaking in the Bundestag, said she was determined to strike a deal with Johnson but that a no-deal Brexit could not be ruled out.
Merkel also warned of the economic threat that the UK could pose. Johnson had privately told EU diplomats during his time as foreign secretary of his desire to build a “buccaneering” Britain, which has been seen as an indication of his plan to recast the UK as a low-tax and low-regulation state.
Merkel’s comments indicate the difficulty that the British government will face in striking what it has described as a “best in class” free trade deal if it fails to match EU standards on goods, workers’ rights, tax and the environment, among others.
EU sources have said that the UK will need to sign up to more onerous, level playing-field obligations than Canada due to the UK’s proximity and the size of its economy.
Diplomats in Brussels said that the British government would be presented with a “Canada minus minus”, potentially including tariffs on some goods, if it seeks to strike a free trade deal without the full array of commitments currently contained in the political declaration on the future relationship agreed with Theresa May.
Merkel told German parliamentarians: “We still have every chance of getting an orderly [Brexit] and the German government will do everything it can to make that possible – right up to the last day. But I also say we are prepared for a disorderly Brexit.
“But the fact remains that after the withdrawal of Britain, we have an economic competitor at our door, even if we want to keep close economic, foreign and security cooperation and friendly relations.
“On the one hand, as Europeans we are weaker with Britain’s exit – that has to be said – but on the other hand, this is the moment to develop new strengths.”
She added: “No country in the world can solve its problems alone and if we all work against each other we will not win. I believe in win-win situations, if we work together.”
A UK government spokesman said: “The UK is seeking to agree a free trade agreement. The EU have always said this is available. Any level playing-field provisions will need to reflect this end state.”
The intervention from Berlin came as France’s minister for Europe, Amélie de Montchalin, accused the UK of breaking “the spirit” of the negotiations by trying to strike “mini-deals” with individual EU member states.
“We see that in the bilateral meetings the British try to get with their opposite numbers that they are trying to organise a managed no deal,” she told a news conference after meeting the 26 ambassadors to France of the EU’s members. The British ambassador was excluded. “And what the British want is to ensure that the different relationships that they have with each EU member state are recreated before the moment of separation, thanks to these mini deals. It is completely contrary to the spirit in which we’ve been negotiating. When [Stephen] Barclay [the UK Brexit secretary] or others try this in France, we say: ‘We hear you. Go and talk to Michel Barnier to see what can be done at the European level.’”
De Montchalin said a no deal was now “highly possible”. She added that a Brexit extension request by the UK would not be accepted under the “current conditions” and the the EU27 would deal with the UK prime minister and not parliament.
She said: “We first have to receive a formal ask. Governments talk to the commission, that’s the way it works. There is no such thing, for example, as parliament asking for an extension. Those who have the legitimacy to represent a country are those who sit at the table of the European council.“If – and that’s a big if, it seems … we try to follow what’s happening in the UK – but if there is such an ask, we have always said that ‘time for time’ is not an option. So if there is a change in the political scene – a new government, the announcement of elections, something that makes us think the landscape of the discussions is changing – then we will consider an extension.“I cannot tell you now what might be decided now in such a situation on a night in Brussels in October,” the French minister added. “As we have said, under current circumstances, the answer is no: if nothing changes, we have always said time alone is not a sufficient reason [for another extension]. We cannot commit today, because we have no concrete scenarios yet.”"

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has said the rights and freedoms of people in Hong Kong “must be guaranteed” after meeting with the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, in Beijing.
Hong Kong has faced months of pro-democracy protests, and ahead of Merkels three-day visit to China this week demonstrators in the semi-autonomous city appealed to the German chancellor to support them in her meetings with China’s leaders.
Merkel said she had discussed tensions in the former British colony, and civil rights there, with her hosts and had “pointed out that these rights and freedoms must of course be guaranteed”.
“In the current situation, everything must be done to avoid violence,” Merkel said at a joint press conference with Li.
“And the solutions can only be found in a political process – meaning through dialogue.”
Merkel arrived in China on Thursday with a large business delegation in tow. The companies travelling with Merkel include Volkswagen, Allianz and Deutsche Bank, according to the German daily Bild, which carried a headline Friday that read: “Do our companies not care about Hong Kong’s freedom?”
Press access to her visit was unusually tight, with a number of members of the Beijing foreign press corps, including AFP, unable to get accreditation for the event.
In a statement, the German Federation of Journalists criticised the limited access as a “diplomatic farce”.
“What image do the organisers have of the travelling German press? Did they think that the chancellor of Germany is coming with her courtiers, who politely listen, ask no questions and report meekly?” it said. Chinese officials blamed a lack of space due to a large contingent of journalists accompanying Merkel.
Merkel also met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on Friday evening, according to state news agency Xinhua, and the two leaders were scheduled to have dinner together.
Xi said that with unilateralism and protectionism posing a serious threat to world stability it is “increasingly important” for China and Germany to strengthen cooperation, on the basis of mutual respect, Xinhua reported.
The German leader is also due to give a speech to university students in the central city of Wuhan on Saturday.
Ahead of her trip, prominent Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong and others had recalled, in an open letter published by Bild on Wednesday, that Merkel grew up in the communist police state of East Germany.
“You have firsthand experience of the terrors of a dictatorial government,” the letter read.
“We hope that you will express your concern about our catastrophic situation, and that you will convey our demands to the Chinese government during your stay in China.”
Hong Kong has endured dozens of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests triggered by opposition to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.
In their open letter the protesters also warned that “Germany should be on its guard before doing business with China, as China does not comply with international law and has repeatedly broken its promises”.
A number of Chinese dissidents have been given refuge in Germany, including the artist Ai Weiwei.
In May two former Hong Kong independence activists were granted refugee status in Germany in what is one of the first cases of dissenters from the semi-autonomous Chinese city receiving such protection.
On a visit to China in 2018, Merkel met with the wife of a Chinese human rights lawyer charged with state subversion, an extremely rare meeting between a dissident and a visiting head of state.
The trip marks her 12th visit to China as chancellor.
Xinhua said China accounted for the largest share of imports into Germany in 2018 with goods worth €106.2 bn ($117.4 bn)."

They may have captured the public’s imagination, but the tiny, pink panda cubs born at Berlin zoo a few days ago have also spurred a national debate about whether panda diplomacy is blinding Germany to the Chinese government’s human rights record.
As visitors and journalists queue around the block to catch a glimpse of Meng Meng’s cubs, a competition to name them has increased pressure on the government of Angela Merkel, who kicked off a trip to Beijing with a large economic delegation on Thursday.
The German tabloid Bild has called on Berliners to choose Hong and Kong as names for the cubs, in recognition of the protests that have been taking place in the territory for the past three months.
Der Tagesspiegel newspaper has also taken up the baton, with its readers favouring Hong and Kong above the alternatives Yin and Yang, Ping and Pong, Plisch and Plum, and Max and Moritz, after a favourite German children’s story.
“Bild is choosing to call the panda cubs Hong and Kong because it’s China’s brutal politics that lies behind these panda babies,” Bild wrote in a headline story on Thursday. “Bild is demanding of the German government that it reacts in a political way to the birth of these small bears.”
Even Hong Kong activists have been pulled into the debate, with the leading protester Joshua Wong urging the zoo to call the cubs Democracy and Freedom. “That way Germany could send a very clear signal to China,” Wong told Bild.
The animal rights campaign group Peta said it was an opportune time to draw attention to pandas’ exploitation. “The panda babies face a sad life as a public attraction. They will never get to know their natural habitat in the mountain forests of China,” said a spokesman. “They have only been bred in the first place because of politics, prestige and profit.”
Germany has been renting six-year-old Meng Meng (which means Sweet Dream) and her companion, Jiao Qing, nine – who is the cubs’ father – from the Chinese government for €1m (£900,000) a year since 2017, under an agreement valid for 15 years.
Merkel and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, opened the bears’ enclosure together amid huge fanfare, in what was billed as an expression of friendship between the two industrial power rivals.
And the pandas have proved to be the hoped-for visitor magnet. A record of 5 million visitors last year was put down to the presence of the pandas, which are by far the zoo’s most popular attraction, with the queues to see them often stretching through the zoo.
There has been no official word yet on the cubs’ future. But according to the agreement drawn up between Berlin and Beijing, the cubs officially belong to China, which will in all probability reserve its right to name them. The cubs are likely to be sent to China in about three or four years’ time when they are able to fend for themselves.
Vets and carers have been flown into Berlin from China to care for the cubs who, when they are not being breastfed by their mother, are being housed in incubators borrowed from the Charité hospital’s neonatal unit. The zoo said the public would be able to see them in November, “by which time they should look more like panda bears”, according to a spokesman, who said the zoo was expecting another surge in visitors."

A reformed EU can stop it";"With anti-immigration parties flourishing, Europe’s inequalities and injustices must be tackled to counter the extremists
As migrants from Syria poured into Germany throughout the summer of 2015, Angela Merkel responded with the reassurance: “We can manage this.” The phrase came to define Merkel’s chancellorship, setting her apart from the rest of the European elite for its humanitarian commitment to the refugee crisis.
For the far right, Merkel’s welcoming response symbolised all that was wrong with Europe. They declared her out of touch with ordinary, working people. Across European capitals moderates were also incandescent . Some rejected the approach in principle, advocating “securing” EU borders instead. Others saw it as a well-intentioned but muddled gesture, a gift to the far right.
On the surface it might now appear that those who warned the far right would capitalise on Merkel’s openness were correct. The Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party has, after all, gained significant electoral support – an unprecedented phenomenon in Germany’s post-war history.
Founded in 2013 as a conservative, Eurosceptic party opposed to the euro, the AfD has moved steadily to the fascistic right. Highly inflammatory rhetoric, previously rare in the country’s democratic politics, has been normalised. “We will hunt Mrs Merkel,” said the party leader, Alexander Gauland, following the 2017 national election, “we will take back our country and our people.”
Events this week have again underlined how the party is a dominant force in the states of the former East Germany. In the Saxony and Brandenburg state elections on September 1, the party achieved its best ever set of results, coming second place in both.
They were denied victory in Brandenburg only by a better than expected result for the Social Democratic party (SPD). The AfD cleverly triangulated the slogan, “We are the people”, raised by the protesters who brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989. They have turned this expression of democratic resistance into a totem of opposition to multiculturalism, and in the run-up to the state elections they even compared contemporary Germany with the GDR, urging people to bring down the “corrupt” system.
It is too simplistic however to put the rise of the AfD down to Germany’s relatively liberal response to the migration crisis. This view accepts too many of the far right’s own arguments about why people are turning to them.
Migration is a crucial factor in AfD support, but not in the way politicians assume
As we show in our new report, there are significant regional differences in the support for the party across Germany. We found that neither a high unemployment rate nor a higher proportion of foreigners in a neighbourhood correspond to a greater willingness to vote for the AfD. States and regions with high levels of immigration are not strongholds for the party. Among every other group of voters in the German federal republic there is strong opposition to the AfD. All major parties have categorically ruled out a formal coalition with the party. In this sense, its rise has been contained to a degree, especially among West German voters, where the party wins on average half the share of votes it picks up in the former East German states.
Migration is a crucial factor in AfD support, but not in the way politicians assume. AfD voters are concentrated in regions that have experienced large waves of outward migration since reunification. Young people in particular moved westwards, leaving ageing populations and economic stagnation in their wake. These towns of the forgotten Germany have proved to be fertile ground for the AfD.
The AfD’s rise should profoundly concern all Europeans. Nearly a third of the party now align with the extreme-right platform, the Wing, whose leaders play down Nazi-era atrocities and argue that foreign “intruders” are overwhelming ethnic Germans. The strength of the party lies in its ability to unite these extremists with more conservative, neoliberal members in one fragile but stable party of the German right.
Misdiagnosing the reasons for the AfD’s growth carries huge risks. Having lost a million voters to the AfD, Merkel’s party, the CDU, has responded with a rightwing turn on migration, cutting benefits and facilitating detention, deportation, and criminalisation of migrant and human rights activists. Merkel has overseen this policy shift, announcing in September 2016 that she would no longer use the “we can manage this” slogan.
This week’s state elections show that the approach is failing. The starting point for an alternative is recognising that Germany’s regional inequalities are unacceptably high and have fuelled the rise of the far right. Increased investment in the east of Germany to create jobs and growth can be at the heart of a new policy to address the roots of the AfD’s support. The creation of the eurozone, which regulates fiscal investment and monetary policy, also makes this a Europe-wide issue. Indeed, reforms to the EU are not an optional luxury for a strong counter-extremism strategy. They are an essential foundation on which a better, more socially just, Europe can be forged.

European leaders, including Germany’s Angela Merkel, will mark the 80th anniversary of the start of the second world war in Warsaw on Sunday. But Donald Trump – who cancelled on his Polish hosts at the last-minute last week, citing concerns over a hurricane barrelling towards Florida – was due to spend the day at his golf club in Virginia.
The conflict began in the early hours of 1 September 1939, when a Nazi battleship attacked a garrison of Polish soldiers at Westerplatte. Poland’s government had moved this year’s commemorations from Westerplatte, near the Baltic port city of Gdansk, to Warsaw, in anticipation of a visit from the US president, who was to give the keynote speech. But Trump cancelled, citing Hurricane Dorian , and sent vice-president Mike Pence in his stead.
Shortly after Trump cancelled, Merkel made a last-minute announcement that she would attend. Yesterday it emerged that Trump, who had given the impression he would spend the day at Camp David with experts to monitor Dorian’s progress, had in fact flown by helicopter from Camp David to his Virginia golf club. He is expected to return to Washington on Sunday to attend a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).
Those attending in Warsaw will include the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, at the head of a British delegation, while London mayor Sadiq Khan will mark the anniversary in Gdansk, where the liberal-led city authorities are hosting their own events.
On 3 September, two days after the attack on Westerplatte and following a Nazi assault on other parts of Poland, British prime minister Neville Chamberlain made his famous radio declaration that “this country is now at war with Germany”. Despite this, little practical assistance was given to Poland, which was crushed within weeks by the Nazis and invaded by the Soviet Union from the east, according to a pact signed by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin in August 1939 that contained a secret protocol by which the two powers would divide Europe.
Ten years ago in Westerplatte, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, called the treaty a “mistake”, but a recent Russian campaign has sought to rehabilitate the controversial treaty. It has been met with outrage in Poland and elsewhere in central Europe and is one of the reasons why Putin was not invited to Warsaw this year.
Poland’s government, ruled by the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, believes other countries do not appreciate the level of Poland’s suffering during the war, but has been accused in recent years of rewriting history by emphasising heroism at the expense of darker pages. The government also wants Germany to pay reparations for war damage, an issue the current German government insists is not on the table. A parliamentary commission is currently working on drawing up an estimate of the amount to be demanded from Berlin, though the issue is unlikely to be raised during the commemoration.
Poland’s government has been at loggerheads with the EU over rule of law issues, but has been praised by Trump, and there was hope that his visit would give them a boost ahead of elections due next month.

She was meant to be the “mini-Merkel” who would grow to fill the German chancellor’s shoes. But after a series of own goals and a poor result for her party in the European elections, and with further trouble looming in state polls in eastern Germany in early September, questions are growing over Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer’s ability to act as a peacemaker between the conservative and liberal wings of her party.
Promoted first to leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in 2018 and then to the post of defence minister last month, Kramp-Karrenbauer remains the most promising candidate to take over when Merkel steps down at the end of her current term.
But if AKK, as she is known, used to enjoy a reputation as a decisive risk-taker while state leader of the Saarland region, she is now increasingly criticised for her thin skin and impulsive communicative missteps.
In March, Kramp-Karrenbauer bewildered modernisers in her party with jokes about gender-neutral bathrooms at a carnival event. In May, when a leading German YouTube star released a viral video in which he took apart the CDU’s track record in government, Kramp-Karrenbauer’s response seemed to exacerbate rather than calm the storm.
A joke about the CDU being held responsible for the “seven plagues of Egypt” backfired: did the Catholic politician really not know the Old Testament listed 10 plagues? An attempt at a more serious response, talking of the need for clearer rules for digital opinion formers, led to her being accused of trying to censor the internet.
“A few little digs are enough for AKK to break out of her reserve”, wrote the newspaper Die Welt. “She’s different to chancellor Merkel, who would have just pulled the plug by refusing to take any more questions or escaping into platitudes.”
In June, many were irritated by the manner in which Kramp-Karrenbauer celebrated a CDU candidate beating an AfD rival to the mayorship in the town of Görlitz, seemingly forgetting that the Green and left parties had withdrawn their candidates to put up a united front against the far right.
And this week she faced criticism from the youth wing of the CDU for implying that she could expel a former head of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency from the party.
Talking about Hans-Georg Maaßen, who alarmed many of his peers by sharing far-right views in tweets and interviews, Kramp-Karrenbauer said: “There are high hurdles for expelling someone from a party, and with good reason. But in Mr Maaßen I no longer see an attitude that ties him to the CDU.”
In the same interview with Funke Media Group, she likened the Werteunion, a rightwing pressure group within the CDU of which Maaßen is a founding member, to America’s Tea Party movement.
Although Maaßen is a controversial figure in the country at large, some CDU campaigners see the former civil servant as useful in upcoming elections in Brandenburg and Saxony on 1 September, where the CDU could be defeated by the far-right AfD.
“I would have preferred us to achieve victories on the town squares of Saxony and Brandenburg”, said Tilman Kuban, the leader of the CDU’s youth wing, telling Deutschlandfunk radio that it was important to tolerate internal differences of opinion. “I didn’t necessarily expect own goals from Berlin,” Kuban said. Kramp-Karrenbauer later clarified that she did not intend to expel Maaßen.
The latest rhetorical misstep has further tarnished Kramp-Karrenbauer’s standing in her party and prompted memories of Merkel’s ability to smooth over internal divisions during her time as party leader.
“Since taking over as leader of the CDU, Kramp-Karrenbauer has worked hard to reach out to the rightwing of her party”, said Kristina Dunz, a journalist for the Rheinische Post newspaper who has written a biography of the politician. “But in the process she has deserted the political centre and alienated many people who supported her candidacy in the first place.”
Kramp-Karrenbauer had manoeuvred herself into a tight spot, suggested weekly Der Spiegel. “The conservatives in her party now know that they can’t count on their leader. The liberals don’t trust her to protect Merkel’s legacy”.
The newspaper Die Zeit said of the Maaßen row: “This would never have happened to Angela Merkel. She would have simply ignored Maaßen until he lost his wit or left the party for the AfD out of his own accord.”
Opinion polls for the Saxony elections suggest the CDU could win by the narrowest of margins over the AfD. The polls put the party on 28%, compared with 39% in the last elections in the state in 2014.
In the state of Brandenburg, also in the formerly socialist east, the party that has dominated postwar German politics could even come second behind the far right, with only 18% of the vote.
“If the CDU drops below the AfD in Saxony and Brandenburg on 1 September, it could be the case that she has to bury her dreams of becoming chancellor”, said Tilman Mayer, a political scientist at Bonn University.
Mayer told Focus magazine that the mounting pressure on Kramp-Karrenbauer could lead to the CDU going into the next election with a more conservative candidate such as Friedrich Merz, a former CDU parliamentary leader, or a more clear-cut liberal such as the North Rhine-Westphalia premier, Armin Laschet.
The Rheinische Post’s Dunz said: “In the age of social media, it’s increasingly impossible for politicians to get things right in the public eye at all. But the fact is that Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer is still trying to find her feet on the national stage, and she is running out of time.”"
"58";"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/26/biarritz-g7-syria-us-china-trade";2019-08-26;"Biarritz was an empty charade. The G7 is a relic of a bygone age";"From Syria to the US-China trade war, the list of issues left untackled by the world’s leaders is shamefully long
The G7 summit in Biarritz, now thankfully concluded, told us a lot about the world we live in. Unfortunately, very little of it was useful or vaguely hopeful. As the presidents and premiers of the world’s wealthiest countries posed for back-slapping group photos, and their partners sampled croissants at a charming “traditional Basque bakery”, fierce fires raged untended and unquenched across the international landscape – not to mention in the Amazon rainforest. It was a low-yield meeting whose main achievement was avoiding a repeat of last year’s bust-up.
It was as though these summiteers, conflabbing while the world burned, belonged to a different, distant era when the US president, for example, was a figure commanding instant respect; when multilateral diplomacy worked; when the postwar internationalist vision was not obscured by nationalist demagoguery; when, if the western democracies decided to do something together, it actually had a good chance of getting done. But those times have passed.
The summit told us about leadership – or what passes for it these days. For Emmanuel Macron, the understandably frazzled maitre d’, concentrating the minds of so many inflated political egos was more challenging than taming the domestic challenge of les gilets jaunes (yellow vests). France’s president abandoned the usual practice of issuing a joint communiqué. After Donald Trump trashed the last one in Quebec, insulting his hosts, that was probably wise.
Yet Trump is not the only black hole where a leader should be. It’s true Angela Merkel is counting down to retirement in 2021. But any hopes that she would pick up the baton where American leadership has failed since 2016, at least as a champion for Europe, have proved ill-founded. Her cautious, money-minded approach has too often focused instead on reining in Macron’s grander reformist ideas.
A German chancellor might at one time have confidently looked to Britain to add weight and mettle to Europe’s views on, say, Vladimir Putin’s war on domestic political opponents and unchecked disregard for international law in Ukraine and Syria. But Boris Johnson, while agreeing Russia’s president should not be readmitted to the G7, exhibits scant interest in, let alone leadership on, such difficult issues. His “keep Trump happy” policy shows how low, and how quickly, Britain is sinking.
Others gathered round the table at Biarritz are not much better. Where is the leader who will stand up and tell Trump, to his face, that his incendiary bid to bring Iran to its knees will not work – and cannot be supported? Who will tell Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, whose forces attacked no fewer than three regional neighbours – Iraq, Lebanon and Syria – at the weekend, to stop stoking regional fires in the hope of winning re-election next month?
What has the G7 got to say about the reduction of the UN security council to a state of feeble impotence, where Russian and Chinese (and sometimes US) vetoes prevent effective action to mitigate humanitarian disasters such as the Saudi-led war in Yemen or the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar? What about the atrocities daily visited upon besieged Syrian civilians in Idlib? And where is the G7 clubbers’ masterplan for rescuing the global economy from a trade war-driven recession? No China, no comment – while Trump shifts shiftily almost by the hour.
The shaming list of roads not travelled, of issues not tackled, of calamities ignored or dodged, is all but endless. To this must be added the accelerating US-China-Russia nuclear arms race and the environmental impact of great power rivalries in the Arctic. To his credit, and to the annoyance of Trump officials who deemed it a “niche issue”, Macron gained support for collective action on the Amazon. As with previous G7 pledges, follow-through is what matters now. Having outwardly responded to the public clamour, what will actually be done? The $20m aid package announced today to help Amazon countries fight wildfires appears, frankly, on the low side.
The summit inadvertently told us, too, about multilateralism and the fabled rules-based international order – and how these always flawed systems of global governance, symbolised by the G7 since the 1970s, may be on their last legs. That’s due in large part to the refusal of emerging 21st-century powers, principally China but also lesser states, to abide by other people’s rules ill-suited to their purposes.
It’s due to a broad upsurge, in Europe and elsewhere, of rightwing, populist nationalism that has shaken the centrist consensus and is typified by the rise and rise of Matteo Salvini in Italy – and by Brexit. It is due to a failure of confidence among post-2008 western democracies which are beset by austerity and widening wealth and trust gaps. Multilateralism’s atrophy is due, too, to multiple betrayals by Trump’s America.
Yet if the Biarritz summit told us fairly conclusively that the G7 is no longer fit for purpose, what if anything can replace it? The paradox of our age is that the world has never been more connected, yet the political tools for acting collectively in pursuit of common purposes are increasingly ineffective. Scrap the G7 and expand the G20, making it a more genuinely inclusive forum? Reboot the UN, either by reforming the security council or making the general assembly its primary decision-making body? Or start again from scratch?
A fundamental rethink may be unavoidable, given that the US will host next year’s G7. Trump is certain to manipulate the meeting for political and personal advantage, reducing other leaders to walk-on extras in his noxious re-election drama. It’s time to think again about who rules the world, and how – while there’s still a world left to rule.

On an unfavourable day, viewing Brexit-era Britain from the outside is like watching a goldfish circling the castle ornament in its bowl. The country seems short of memory, hazy of sight and prone to fluttering around kitsch visions of the past.
The reporting of Boris Johnson’s tour of Europe was a case in point. Eurosceptic tabloids celebrated the supposed infectiousness of the prime minister’s optimism: “Ja, we can,” ventriloquised the Daily Mail over a photo of Angela Merkel sharing a drink with him. On Friday, the newspaper covered his return from a meeting with Emmanuel Macron with a shot of him raising his hands over his head in victory. By contrast, some Remainers saw in Merkel’s comment – “we could also find [a solution] in the next 30 days, why not?” – an attempt to mock or troll the prime minister. They rolled their eyes at film footage seemingly showing Macron urging Johnson to get his feet off a table during their meeting in the Élysée Palace.
The Brexiters were farthest from the mark. It was simply not true, as even the BBC implied, that Merkel suggested that the Northern Irish backstop has a decent chance of being replaced within a month. And Peter Oborne’s claim in the Mail that “Johnson triumphed in Berlin” was utter nonsense. The German chancellor had not remotely wavered from her red lines. Like other EU leaders, she remains committed to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and will only resile from the backstop if Britain comes up with a viable alternative. Macron went even further, stressing that the mechanism is “indispensable”.
Yet neither did the prime minister experience the slap-downs that some on the other end of the spectrum detected. Merkel’s comments were no mockery; not for the first time, British commentators of various stripes were reading too much into her words. And full footage of the Paris incident showed Macron joking that Johnson could put his feet on the table. The prime minister obliged only for fractions of a second, cameras flashing, before continuing their conversation in a more respectful pose.
While EU leaders have not changed their conditions, the looming deadline of 31 October is prompting them to re-engage with the question of how to make those conditions sellable in Britain. Their exasperation mingles with regret and a serious desire to minimise the losses from Brexit. Not for them the childish diversion of trolling a major head of government for likes.
The facts, the raw realpolitik, of the matter are quite simple. EU leaders want to protect Ireland and believe that they have already gone far enough in Britain’s direction by proposing a backstop allowing some of the benefits of full membership without the costs. Brexiters want to leave the club on unrealistically favourable terms and under their current leadership tend to impatience. Remainers want to stop the process, but are divided and do not have an easy path to power. Any deal will require compromise. In the absence of a mutually acceptable deal, the EU is, of the two parties, the much larger and better prepared to walk. The brutal logic of 1:9, the ratio of British to remaining EU GDP, cannot be gainsaid. Seen from some corners of Brussels, such calculations are the only ones that matter.
This bare reading of the facts is misleading, however, as it does not take into account what one might call the history factor. Perceptions of history are emotional. They get in the way of bald calculations of power and narrow advantage. That makes the developments of the next weeks much harder to game out than the realpolitik alone might suggest.
The subject is the interest linking all of the major players in the Brexit drama. Macron and Merkel are both history nerds and devour books on it. The chancellor celebrated her 60th birthday five years ago by inviting the historian Jürgen Osterhammel to lecture her guests on “the horizon of history”. She later gave members of her cabinet copies of The Sleepwalkers, Christopher Clark’s account of the prelude to the first world war. Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg have both written their own, albeit poorly reviewed, history books, while Dominic Cummings writes about alternative outcomes of recent political events as “branching histories”. For their part, Remainers often turn to Britain’s intensively European past for proof of the country’s essential link to the continent. And all sides, implicitly, have a historian’s nagging interest in the future; in what the past says about what is to come; in what sort of places Britain and Europe will be in 2100 or so.
This Historikerstreit may make a no-deal Brexit more likely. Remainers see their struggle as a battle for the country’s open, European soul. Brexiters are often fond of Britain’s supposedly buccaneering (the term seems almost obligatory) past and want a similarly free-roaming future. All of that makes the two sides within Britain fiendishly hard to reconcile.
Meanwhile, Merkel considers it her historical role to keep Europe together in turbulent times, which means ensuring that Brexit does not entail the sort of benefits without costs that would make leaving the club, or threatening to do so, a tempting option for others. And Macron wants his presidency to be remembered as the time when not just France but Europe fought back against decline and defended its common sovereignty in a world increasingly defined by rival power blocs. His long-termist ambitions leave scant room to coddle Britain: the president fears that Brexit is taking up time and energy that might be used in making the rest of Europe fit for the future. With the prospect of parliament agreeing to a compromise deal low, he is more inclined than Merkel to cut Britain loose.
A clear sense of history can, however, also strengthen the case for compromise. Spoiled by their island history, Britons are relatively blithe about chaos and rupture, but even this has its limits. Remainers and most Brexiters fear a no deal and neither side wants to be held responsible for the disruption it would probably unleash, for the national change of course it could cause. Nor does any continental European leader want to go down as being responsible for that chaos. The EU is more concerned than Westminster realises about the geopolitics of a hard or no-deal Brexit. Its leaders are kept awake at night not by the prospect of reduced BMW sales but of Britain falling prey to a tug-of-war between big external powers such as the US and China. The meetings in Berlin and Paris were thus more nuanced than either sides of Britain’s polarised politics acknowledged.
Technocratic debates will seem to dominate the next few weeks. But they will be but a battleground on which rival historical visions, theories about the past and hopes for the future, will clash. Where facts are contested or still to be made, emotions reign. And so it is in the Brexit saga. The entities of “Germany” and “France”, “Brexiters” and “Remainers”, not to mention various other EU countries and intermediate and sub-camps in the British political ring, all contain contradictory impulses. All are in flux. Prominent players of all shades are constantly assessing and reassessing their place in history. Johnson’s meetings, including his G7 debut in Biarritz on Sunday, only emphasise this contest between rival pasts and futures.
How, given these realities, might a no deal still be avoided? The coming struggle pits history or, more precisely, the perception of it as a motor for a no-deal Brexit against history as a motor for compromise and de-escalation. The risk of fragmentation from a no deal must appear greater to continental Europeans than that of fragmentation under a compromise deal. Compromise must somehow be made to seem to the Brexiters currently running the show in Britain a better path to national redemption and self-realisation than a no deal. Remainers must be persuaded that history will look more kindly on them for stopping a no deal than for cleaving unbendingly to the immediate goal of stopping Brexit. And then? Who knows. New British elections and new leadership in Brussels both beckon. Change, in some form, can come.
Brexit-era Britain is, in fact, the very opposite of a goldfish in its bowl. It is at once crippled and empowered by long memories. History is a force in itself, pushing mere mortals around. It can engender fatalism. But it is also an emotional, human creation. And like all human creations, ultimately, it is capable of being mastered.

Angela Merkel has backed Emmanuel Macron’s call to put the fires in the Amazon on the agenda at this weekend’s G7 summit, after the French president said the situation amounted to an international crisis.
Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for the German chancellor, told journalists in Berlin on Friday: “The extent of the fires in the Amazon area is shocking and threatening, not only for Brazil and the other affected countries, but also for the whole world.
“When the G7 comes together this weekend, then the chancellor is convinced that this acute emergency in the Amazon rainforest belongs on the agenda.”
Macron’s intervention had prompted a furious response from his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro. “I regret that President Macron seeks to take advantage of what is a domestic Brazilian issue and of other Amazonian countries for personal political gain,” the rightwing leader tweeted, targeting what he called Macron’s “sensationalist tone”.
In a second tweet, he said: “The French president’s suggestion that Amazonian matters be discussed at the G7 without the involvement of countries of the region recalls the colonialist mindset that is unacceptable in the 21st century.”
Later, Brazil’s foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo, weighed in with a thread on Twitter, condemning the “savage and unfair” international campaign against his nation. Araújo claimed the campaign was being waged “because President Bolsonaro’s government is rebuilding Brazil”.
He added: “The ‘environmental crisis’ appears to be the last weapon left in the arsenal of leftist lies to smother this fact.”
Earlier one of Bolsonaro’s top foreign advisers also tweeted a reprimand to foreign meddlers. “God does not like liars,” Filipe Martins wrote in a series of posts rebutting international criticism.
Bolsonaro’s politician son, Eduardo, continued the offensive, tweeting a YouTube video called “Macron is an idiot” to his 1.6 million followers.
But international concern continued to be expressed over the scale of the fires. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he was deeply concerned: “In the midst of the global climate crisis, we cannot afford more damage to a major source of oxygen and biodiversity.”
London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, tweeted that the fires were being “aided and abetted by the Brazilian government”. The burning of the rainforest was “an act of shocking environmental vandalism with global consequences”.
Celebrities including Madonna also weighed in on Thursday. “The Fires Are Raging and The Amazonia continues to burn,” she tweeted.
The Fires Are Raging and The Amazonia continues to burn.........This is a devastation to Brazil—to the indigenous people who live there and the-plant and animal species that make this the most important bio-diverse Forest!!! President Bolsonaro please... https://t.co/YbxldYw8HY pic.twitter.com/lex4UIwHcg
“It is devastating to see our world suffer,” the British Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram.
The footballer Cristiano Ronaldo tweeted about the urgency of the Amazon fires, saying it’s “our responsibility to help save the planet”.
The Amazon Rainforest produces more than 20% of the world’s oxygen and its been burning for the past 3 weeks. It’s our responsibility to help to save our planet. #prayforamazonia pic.twitter.com/83bNL5a37Q
Brazil has had more than 72,000 fires this year, an 84% increase on the same period in 2018, said the country’s National Institute for Space Research. More than half were in the Amazon.
There was a sharp rise in deforestation during July, which has been followed by extensive burning in August. Local newspapers say farmers in some regions are organising “fire days” to take advantage of weaker enforcement by the authorities.
Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, on Thursday said he had spoken to Bolsonaro and would send three “brigades of specialists in forest fires and environmental research, who will help mitigate the tragedy in the Amazon rainforest”."
